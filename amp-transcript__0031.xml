               </p>
               <p>
                  Dear Ed,<lb/>
                  The time has come to send out a signal to you from this<lb/>
                  ancient, scandal-ridden, provincial dump.  Peter Müller has<lb/>
                  not been sleeping over his plan to edit a book on Auden´s<lb/>
                  time here, he has been writing books himself in addition to<lb/>
                  his full time profession.  Now - you may know this - it is<lb/>
                  definite and the book is to come out in February 1987 in<lb/>
                  time for A´s 80th.<lb/>
                  So he got me back to my desk, to, in his words, combine<lb/>
                  my English and German texts, and bring the whole thing up to<lb/>
                  date.  "Write as fully as you can, double the length."  I<lb/>
                  protested that a) I don´t wish to chatter more feebly than I<lb/>
                  have already, b) I am ancient and frail, also lazy, c) the<lb/>
                  first MSS only approximate to each other while containing m<del><unclear></unclear></del>kuch<lb/>
                  the same material;  their tone differs.  But above all they<lb/>
                  have, whether bad or indifferent, a certain shape or form and<lb/>
                  you cannot just stuff more material into it which refers to<lb/>
                  things which hap<del>e</del>pened subsequently.  So we agreed that we would<lb/>
                  leave the texts to stand and that I would say, roughly, okay,<lb/>
                  that was how it looked then;  what has happened since, what<lb/>
                  is there still be said by us, who knew Auden in Kirchstetten<lb/>
                  in view of the fact that Carpenter did no research on this<lb/>
                  location<unclear>s</unclear>?  For a long time the idea was only to write a<lb/>
                  German text, I mean that the book would be sol<del>t´</del>ely German<lb/>
                  l<del>n</del>anguage production, and this I thought until quite recently.<lb/>
                  Suddenly, Peter bounced me with the comment that he would<lb/>
                  "like an English version as well."  I had thought my two texts<lb/>
                  were only to be combined and the sequel written in German.<lb/>
                  This presents technical problems.  For example, and now my<lb/>
                  questions to you begin:<lb/>
                  We ihave here a copy of Auden´s declaration to the tax<lb/>
                  authorities.  (I have been determined all along that this<lb/>
                  document should be published AND RIGHT HERE.  Apart from making<lb/>
                  Them look stupid, it must be unique in literary history that a<lb/>
                  great poet should explain to the tax authorities how poetry<lb/>
                  comes to be written.)  Do you have the English original, or where<lb/>
                  is it;  did it ever exist or was the German drafted by Auden<lb/>
                  and put together by, s<del>y</del>ay, his lawyer?  Or could this have been<lb/>
                  done by whoever it was who wrote the prose version of the<lb/>
                  Weinheber poem?  I have that text which A. gave me, but there<lb/>
                  is no record of who wrote it.  In my first dr<del>s</del>aft of the talk<lb/>
                  given at the PEN Club in London in 1976 I wrote: "I have the<lb/>
                  statement in German translation, so that what I am reading is<lb/>
                  my own re-translation back into English and not the original.<lb/>
                  I should be very grateful if you could help me over the<lb/>
                  address which Auden held at Neulengbach.  I have the original<lb/>
                  English text which to my horror Auden asked me to translate:<lb/>
                  although capable of creative writing in German, to deal with<lb/>
                  this tough text was too m<del>k</del>uch and it was corrected by my husband.<lb/>
                  Müller possesses the German text taken from a tape.  Now this<lb/>
                  English text is so familia<del>s</del>rrto me that it deafens me to all<lb/>
                  or any sources.  A digest of it is in the PEN text but I wonder
               </p>

               <p>
                  - 2 -<lb/>
                  to what extent Auden´s speech contains hitherto unknown material,<lb/>
                  if any.  I said air<del>l</del>ily that he had probably said i<del>a</del>t a<del>s</del>ll before,<lb/>
                  in Secondary Worlds and so on, but this is not true.  After a<lb/>
                  preamble the speech begins:<lb/>
                  Between the ages of six and twelve, I spent a great many of<lb/>
                  my waking hours in the fabrication of a private secondary<lb/>
                  s   sacred world, the basic elements of which were a) a limestone<lb/>
                  landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the North of<lb/>
                  England and b) an industry - lead-mining.<lb/>
                  I<del>r</del>t is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred<lb/>
                  world was autistic - that is to say I had no wish to share<lb/>
                  it with others ...   and so on.<lb/>
                  He goes on to define the Primary and Secondary Worlds;  his<lb/>
                  private world, the restrictions on the freedom of the artist;<lb/>
                  water-turbines, his Platonic idea of a concentrating mill and<lb/>
                  of his moral duty to sacrifice his aesthetic <del>princip </del>preference<lb/>
                  to reality or truth.<lb/>
                  If you like I can have the whole thing photo-copied and<lb/>
                  send it along, but you see what it´s about.  I cannot believe<lb/>
                  that Wystan chose Neulengbach to make a one-time-only<lb/>
                  statement of this length and weight, the idea is absurd and<lb/>
                  the point of my quotation in my talk in 1976 was to show Auden<lb/>
                  in one aspect of his contact with the Austrians, not without<lb/>
                  a touch of hilarity.  But this is not in Secondary Worlds,<lb/>
                  I have leafed through your Early Auden page by page and finkd<lb/>
                  no reference, nor can I find it anywhere else.  Can you<lb/>
                  el<del>i</del>ucidate?<lb/>
                  M<del>Y</del>y worm´s eye view of the arrangements for the funeral<lb/>
                  goes iknto my new piece, and incidentally the contributions<lb/>
                  will be looked over by a lawyer.<lb/>
                  Are you about to come out with a Middle Auden or whatever?<lb/>
                  If so it would be nice to know about it so I can refer to it.<lb/>
                  The chaplain sto the British Embassy in Vienna gave me the<lb/>
                  name and addre<del>e</del>ss of the clergyman who took the service with the<lb/>
                  RC pasrish priest and I wrote to him to find o<del>iu</del>ut´whether he<lb/>
                  can remember the form of service etc. but no answer so far.<lb/>
                  This would be of interest here because though common practice<lb/>
                  in England such an ecumenical service was a novelty here and<lb/>
                  caused much comment.<lb/>
                  How are you and what are you doing apa<del>s</del>rt from teaching?<lb/>
                  I had a lot of illness, hospitals etc. but am now stab<del>l</del>ilised<lb/>
                  and am living now wholly in the country but am well looked<lb/>
                  after and see plenty of people.  It´s Parkinson´s disease<lb/>
                  which can be kept pretty well under control these days.  My<lb/>
                  relations organised a splendid surprise party for my 70th<lb/>
                  birthday which went on all day, at breakfast I didn´t yet<lb/>
                  know <del>t</del>what lay ahead.  My son plotted this and steered it from<lb/>
                  New York but was there on the day.  He built up the Austrian<lb/>
                  bank Creditanstalt-Bankverein in NY, and if ever you need to<lb/>
                  send me bulky papers or whatever - not that you will - contact<lb/>
                  him at 212-702-9101.  His <del>m</del>name is Marko.<lb/>
                  Good health and suc<unclear>c</unclear>ess i<del>j</del>n 1986,
