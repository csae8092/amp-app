                  experience<unclear>s</unclear> as a poet,in the hope that you will be able to compare the<del>,</del>m with<lb/>
                  yours<del><unclear>own</unclear></del>,and form your own judgment about them.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="3" unit="char"/>Most of what I <del><unclear>o</unclear></del>know about the writing of poetry,or at least about the kind I<lb/>
                  am interested in writing,I discovered long before I took any interest in poetry<lb/>
                  itself.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Between the ages of six and twelve,I spent a great many of my waking hours in<lb/>
                  the fab<del>o</del>rication of a private secondary sacred world,the basic elements of which<lb/>
                  were <del><del><unclear>at</unclear></del><unclear>O</unclear></del> a) a limestone landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the<lb/>
                  North of England and b) an industry - lead-mining.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="3" unit="char"/>It is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred world was autistic -<lb/>
                  that is to say,I had no wish to share it with others no<del>t</del>r could I have done so.<lb/>
                  However,though constructed for and inhabited by myself alone,I needed the help of<lb/>
                  others,my parents in particular,in collecting its basic materials; others had to<lb/>
                  procure for me the necessary text-books on geology and machinery,maps,catalog<del>i</del>ues,<lb/>
                  guide-books and photographs,and,when occasion offered<del>,to</del> ta<del>l</del>ke me down real mines,<lb/>
                  tasks which they performed with unfailing patience and generosity.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>From this activity,I learned certain principles which I was later to find applied<lb/>
                  to all artistic fabrication. First,whatever other elements it may include,the<lb/>
                  initial impulse to create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by<lb/>
                  encounters,in the Primary World,with sacred beings or events. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This feeling of awe<lb/>
                  is an imperative,that is to<unclear>´</unclear> say,one is not free to choose the object or the event<lb/>
                  that arouses it. Though every work of art is a secondary world,it cannot be<lb/>
                  constructed <hi rend="underline">ex nihilo</hi>,but is a selection from and a recombination of the contents of<lb/>
                  the Primary World. Even the 'purest' poem,in the French Symboliste sense,is<lb/>
                  made of words which are not the poet's private property,but the communal creation<lb/>
                  of the linguistic group to whom he belongs,so that their meaning can be looked up<lb/>
                  in a dictionary.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Secondly,in constructing my private world,I discovere<del>s</del>d that,though this was<lb/>
                  a game,or rather precisely <hi rend="underline">because it was a game</hi> - that is to say,not a necessity<lb/>
                  like eating or sleeping,but something I was free to do or not as I chose - it<lb/>
                  could not be played without rules. Absolute freedom is meaningless: freedom can<lb/>
                  only be realised in a choice between alternati<del>c</del>ves. A secondary world,be it a poem,<lb/>
                  or a game of football or bridge,must be as much a world of law as the Primary,the<lb/>
                  only difference being that in the world of games one is free to decide what its<lb/>
                  laws shall be. But to all games as to real life,Goethe's lines apply.

                  <space quantity="3" unit="char"/>As regards my particu<del>al</del>l<unclear>a</unclear>r lead-mining world,I decided,or rather,without conscious<lb/>
                  decision I instinctively felt,that I must impose two restrictions upon my freedom<lb/>
                  of fantasy. In choosing what objects were to be included,I was free to select this<lb/>
                  and reject that,on condition that both were real objects in the Primary World,to<lb/>
                  choose,for example,between two kinds of water-turbine,which could be found in a<lb/>
                  text-book <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>on mining machinery or a manufacturer's catalogue: but I was not free<lb/>
                  to invent one. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In deciding how my world was to function,I <del>was </del> could choose between<lb/>
                  t<del><unclear>e</unclear></del>wo practical possibilit<del>es</del>ies <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>- a mine can be drained either by an adit or a pump -<lb/>
                  but physic<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>al impossibili<del>es</del>ties and magic means were forbidden. <del><unclear>T</unclear></del>When I say forbidden,<lb/>
                  I mean that I felt,in some obscure way,that they were morally forbidden. Then there<lb/>
                  came a day when the moral issue became quite conscious. As I was planning my<lb/>
                  Platonic Idea of a concentrating-mill,I ran into difficulties. I had to choose<lb/>
                  between two types of a cer<del>at</del>tain machine for separating the sli<unclear>m</unclear>es,called a buddle.<lb/>
                  One type I found more sacred or '<del>beat<del>i</del>uful</del> beautiful',but the other type was,I<lb/>
                  knew from my reading,the more efficient. At this point I realised that it was my<lb/>
                  moral duty to sacrifice my <del>aethetic</del> aesthetic preference to reality or truth.

                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>When,later,I began to write poetry’I found that,for me,at least,the same<lb/>
                  obligation was binding. That is to say,I cannot accept the do<del><unclear>s</unclear></del>ctrine that,in<lb/>
                  poetry,there is a 'suspension of belief<del><unclear>e</unclear></del>'. A poet must never make a statement<lb/>
                  simply because it sounds poetically exciting: he must also bel<del>ei</del>ieve it to be<lb/>
                  true. This does not mean,of course,that one can only appreciate a poet whose<lb/>
                  beliefs happen to co-incide with one's own. It does mean,however,that one must<lb/>
                  <del>n</del>be convinced that the poet really believ<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>es what he says,however odd <del>that</del> the<lb/>
                  belief may seem to oneself.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="7" unit="char"/>Between constructing a private <del>fantsa</del>yfantasy world for oneself alone<lb/>
                  and writing poetry,there is,of course,a profound difference. A <del>fanatsy</del><lb/>
                  fantasy world exists only in the head of its creator: a poem is a public<lb/>
                  verbal object intended to be read and enjoyed by others. To become conscious<lb/>
                  of others is to become conscious of historical time/. in various ways. The<lb/>
                  contents of a poem are necessarily past <del>expereinces</del> experiences,and the goal of<lb/>
                  a poem is <del>necessaily</del> necessarily in the future,since it cannot be read until<lb/>
                  it has been written. Again<unclear>,</unclear>to write a poem is to engage in an activity which<lb/>
                  human beings have practised for centuries. If one asks why human beings<lb/>
                  make poems or paint pictures or compose music,I can see two possible answers.<lb/>
                  Firstly all the artistic media are forms of an activity pecul<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>iar to human<lb/>
                  beings,namely,Personal Speech. Many animals have impersonal codes of<lb/>
                  communications,visual,olfactory,auditory signals,b<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>y which they convey to<lb/>
                  other members of their species vital information about food,territory,sex,<lb/>
                  the presence of <del>e<unclear>nm</unclear>ies</del> enemies etc,and in social animals like the bee,such<lb/>
                  a code may be exceedingly comple<del>s</del>x. We,too,of course,often use words in the same<lb/>
                  way,as when I ask a stranger the way to the railroad station. But when we<lb/>
                  truly speak,we do something quite different. We <del>spak</del> speak as person to person<lb/>
                  in order to disclose ourselves to others and share our exper<del>ei</del><unclear>i</unclear>ences with<lb/>
                  them,not because we must,but becuase we enjoy doing so. This activity is<lb/>
                  sometimes quite erroneously called 'self-expression'. If I write a poem<lb/>
                  about <del>ceratin</del> experiences I have had,I do so<del>,not bec</del> bec<del>ua</del><unclear>a</unclear>use I think it<lb/>
                  <del>may</del>should be of interest and value to others<del>,not</del>: the fact that it has till now<lb/>
                  only been my exper<del>ei</del>ience is accidental. What the poet or any artist has to convey<lb/>
                  is a perception of a reality common to all,but seen from a unique perpsective,<lb/>
                  which it is his duty as well as his pleasure to share with others. To small<lb/>
                  truths as well as great,St Augustine's words apply.

                  <space quantity="12" unit="char"/><hi rend="underline">The truth is neither mine nor his nor another's;but belongs</hi><lb/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Then the second impulse to artistic fabrication is the desire to transcend<lb/>
                  our mortality,by making objects which,unlike ourselves,are not subject to<lb/>
                  natural death,but can remain <del>permantly</del> permanently 'on hand' in the world,<lb/>
                  long after we and our society have perished.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="3" unit="char"/>Every genuine work of art,I believe,exhibits two qualities,Nowness and<lb/>
                  Permanence. By Nowness I mean the quality which enables an art-historian<lb/>
                  to date a work,at least,approximately. If,for example,one listens to<lb/>
                  a composition by Palestrina and one by Mozart,one knows immediately that,<lb/>
                  quite aside from their artistic merits,Palestrina must have lived earlier<lb/>
                  than Mozart: he could not possibly have written as he did after Mozart.<lb/>
                  By <del>p</del>Perman<del>a</del>ence,I mean <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>that the work continues to have relevance and<lb/>
                  importance lo<unclear>m</unclear>g after its creator is dead. In the history of Art,unlike<lb/>
                  the history of Science,no genuine work of art is made obsolete by a<lb/>
                  later work. Past science is of interest only to the historian of science,not<lb/>
                  to what scientists are doing at this moment. Past works of art,on the<lb/>
                  other hand,are of the utmost importance to the contemporary <del>praticioner<unclear>.</unclear></del><lb/>
                  practic<del>o</del>t<del>o</del>neroner. Every artist tries to produce something new,but in the hope<lb/>
                  that,in time,it will take its <del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>proper place in the tradition of his art.<lb/>
                  And he cannot produce anything significantly original unless he knows<lb/>
                  well what has <del>been</del> already been done<unclear>;</unclear>w<del>ithout</del>,that is to say ,<del>even in</del> he cannot<lb/>
                  'rebel' against the past without having a profound reverence for it.

                  what it had been in the nineteenth century. This meant that for these artists,<lb/>
                  the felt need to create something new arose from an artistic imperative,<lb/>
                  not a <del>histroi</del> historic imperative. No one asked himself:"What is the proper<lb/>

                  always a danger of confusing the principles governing political action and<lb/>
                  those governing artistic fabrication. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The most important of such confus<del>u</del>ions<lb/>
                  are thr<del>r</del>ee.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Firstly,one may come to think of artistic fabrication as <del>s</del><unclear>a</unclear> f<del>rom</del>orm of politic<unclear>a</unclear>l<lb/>
                  action. Every citizen,<del>artists</del>poets includ<del>i</del>ed,has a duty to be politically 'engagé',<lb/>
                  that is,to <del>feel</del> play a responsible part in seeing that the society of which<lb/>
                  he is a member shall function properly and improve. But the poet,qua poet,<lb/>
                  has only one political function. Since lang<del>i</del>uage is his medium,it is his duty,<lb/>
                  by his own example,to defend his <del>mot<del>eh</del>her</del>mothermother-tongue against corruption by demagogues,<lb/>
                  journalists,the mass-media etc. As Karl Kraus<del>s</del> said:"D<hi rend="underline">ie Sprache ist die</hi> <del>Muuet</del><lb/>
                  <hi rend="underline">Mutter,nicht das Magd,des <del>d</del> <del>g</del>Gedankens"</hi>,and when language loses its meaning,<lb/>
                  its <del>palce</del> place is taken by violence. Of course,the poet may use political and<lb/>
                  social events as subject-matter for poems - they are as much a part of human<lb/>
                  experience as love or nature - but he must never imagine that his poems have<lb/>
                  the power to affect the course of history. The political and social history<lb/>
                  of Europe w<unclear>o</unclear>uld be what it <del>ahs</del> has been if Dante,Shakepeare,Goethe,Micha<del>le</del>el<lb/>

                  to the whole,would be a nightmare of horror for,given the historical reality of<lb/>
                  actual men,such a society could only come into being through selective breeding,<lb/>

                  societies at this time,is the opposite of Plato's,namely to take political<lb/>
                  act<del>u</del>ion as the model for arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication. Political action is a necessity,<lb/>
                  that is to say,a<del>y</del>t very moment something has to be done,and <del>politicla</del> it<lb/>
                  is momentary - action at this moment is immeiately followed by another action<lb/>

                  the alternative to one work of art can be no work of art - and the artistic<lb/>
                  object is permanent,that is to say,immune to historical change. The attempt<lb/>
                  to model arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication o<del>s</del>n political action can therefore,only<lb/>
                  reduce it to momentary <del>(<unclear>h</unclear> </del> a<del>d</del>nd arbitrary 'happenings',a conformism with<lb/>

                  to have second thoughts,free <del>f</del>him f<del>or</del>rom the fetters of self. All too often,the<lb/>
                  result of not having a fixed form to be true to,is a self-indulgence which in<lb/>
                  the detached reader can only cause boredom. Further,in my exper<del>ei</del>ience ,contrary<lb/>
                  to what one might exp<del>s</del>ect,the <del>writers o</del> free-verse poets sound much more<lb/>
                  like each other than those who write in fixed forms. Whatever freedom may do,<lb/>
                  it does not,it would seem,make for originality.
