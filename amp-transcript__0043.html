                  not out of vanity,but bec<del>ua</del>ause  I do <del>j</del>not wish to give the impression that I<br />
                  am attempting to lay down absolute laws which are valid for all. I give you my<br />
                  experience<abbr title="unclear">s</abbr> as a poet,in the hope that you will be able to compare the<del>,</del>m with<br />
                  yours<del>own</del>,and form your own judgment about them.<br />
                  Most of what I <del>o</del>know about the writing of poetry,or at least about the kind I<br />
                  am interested in writing,I discovered long before I took any interest in poetry<br />
                  itself.<br />
                  Between the ages of six and twelve,I spent a great many of my waking hours in<br />
                  the fab<del>o</del>rication of a private secondary sacred world,the basic elements of which<br />
                  were <del>atO</del> a) a limestone landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the<br />
                  North of England and b) an industry - lead-mining.<br />
                  It is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred world was autistic -<br />
                  that is to say,I had no wish to share it with others no<del>t</del>r could I have done so.<br />
                  However,though constructed for and inhabited by myself alone,I needed the help of<br />
                  others,my parents in particular,in collecting its basic materials; others had to<br />
                  procure for me the necessary text-books on geology and machinery,maps,catalog<del>i</del>ues,<br />
                  guide-books and photographs,and,when occasion offered<del>,to</del> ta<del>l</del>ke me down real mines,<br />
                  tasks which they performed with unfailing patience and generosity.<br />
                  From this activity,I learned certain principles which I was later to find applied<br />
                  to all artistic fabrication. First,whatever other elements it may include,the<br />
                  initial impulse to create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by<br />
                  encounters,in the Primary World,with sacred beings or events.  This feeling of awe<br />
                  is an imperative,that is to<abbr title="unclear">´</abbr> say,one is not free to choose the object or the event<br />
                  that arouses it. Though every work of art is a secondary world,it cannot be<br />
                  constructed ex nihilo,but is a selection from and a recombination of the contents of<br />
                  the Primary World. Even the 'purest' poem,in the French Symboliste sense,is<br />
                  made of words which are not the poet's private property,but the communal creation<br />
                  of the linguistic group to whom he belongs,so that their meaning can be looked up<br />
                  in a dictionary.<br />
                  Secondly,in constructing my private world,I discovere<del>s</del>d that,though this was<br />
                  a game,or rather precisely because it was a game - that is to say,not a necessity<br />
                  like eating or sleeping,but something I was free to do or not as I chose - it<br />
                  could not be played without rules. Absolute freedom is meaningless: freedom can<br />
                  only be realised in a choice between alternati<del>c</del>ves. A secondary world,be it a poem,<br />
                  or a game of football or bridge,must be as much a world of law as the Primary,the<br />
                  only difference being that in the world of games one is free to decide what its<br />
                  laws shall be. But to all games as to real life,Goethe's lines apply.

                  As regards my particu<del>al</del>l<abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>r lead-mining world,I decided,or rather,without conscious<br />
                  decision I instinctively felt,that I must impose two restrictions upon my freedom<br />
                  of fantasy. In choosing what objects were to be included,I was free to select this<br />
                  and reject that,on condition that both were real objects in the Primary World,to<br />
                  choose,for example,between two kinds of water-turbine,which could be found in a<br />
                  text-book  on mining machinery or a manufacturer's catalogue: but I was not free<br />
                  to invent one.  In deciding how my world was to function,I <del>was </del> could choose between<br />
                  t<del>e</del>wo practical possibilit<del>es</del>ies  - a mine can be drained either by an adit or a pump -<br />
                  but physic<del></del>al impossibili<del>es</del>ties and magic means were forbidden. <del>T</del>When I say forbidden,<br />
                  I mean that I felt,in some obscure way,that they were morally forbidden. Then there<br />
                  came a day when the moral issue became quite conscious. As I was planning my<br />
                  Platonic Idea of a concentrating-mill,I ran into difficulties. I had to choose<br />
                  between two types of a cer<del>at</del>tain machine for separating the sli<abbr title="unclear">m</abbr>es,called a buddle.<br />
                  One type I found more sacred or '<del>beatiuful</del> beautiful',but the other type was,I<br />
                  knew from my reading,the more efficient. At this point I realised that it was my<br />
                  moral duty to sacrifice my <del>aethetic</del> aesthetic preference to reality or truth.

               </p><p>
                  When,later,I began to write poetry’I found that,for me,at least,the same<br />
                  obligation was binding. That is to say,I cannot accept the do<del>s</del>ctrine that,in<br />
                  poetry,there is a 'suspension of belief<del>e</del>'. A poet must never make a statement<br />
                  simply because it sounds poetically exciting: he must also bel<del>ei</del>ieve it to be<br />
                  true. This does not mean,of course,that one can only appreciate a poet whose<br />
                  beliefs happen to co-incide with one's own. It does mean,however,that one must<br />
                  <del>n</del>be convinced that the poet really believ<del></del>es what he says,however odd <del>that</del> the<br />
                  belief may seem to oneself.<br />
                  Between constructing a private <del>fantsa</del>yfantasy world for oneself alone<br />
                  and writing poetry,there is,of course,a profound difference. A <del>fanatsy</del><br />
                  fantasy world exists only in the head of its creator: a poem is a public<br />
                  verbal object intended to be read and enjoyed by others. To become conscious<br />
                  of others is to become conscious of historical time/. in various ways. The<br />
                  contents of a poem are necessarily past <del>expereinces</del> experiences,and the goal of<br />
                  a poem is <del>necessaily</del> necessarily in the future,since it cannot be read until<br />
                  it has been written. Again<abbr title="unclear">,</abbr>to write a poem is to engage in an activity which<br />
                  human beings have practised for centuries. If one asks why human beings<br />
                  make poems or paint pictures or compose music,I can see two possible answers.<br />
                  Firstly all the artistic media are forms of an activity pecul<del></del>iar to human<br />
                  beings,namely,Personal Speech. Many animals have impersonal codes of<br />
                  communications,visual,olfactory,auditory signals,b<del></del>y which they convey to<br />
                  other members of their species vital information about food,territory,sex,<br />
                  the presence of <del>enmies</del> enemies etc,and in social animals like the bee,such<br />
                  a code may be exceedingly comple<del>s</del>x. We,too,of course,often use words in the same<br />
                  way,as when I ask a stranger the way to the railroad station. But when we<br />
                  truly speak,we do something quite different. We <del>spak</del> speak as person to person<br />
                  in order to disclose ourselves to others and share our exper<del>ei</del><abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>ences with<br />
                  them,not because we must,but becuase we enjoy doing so. This activity is<br />
                  sometimes quite erroneously called 'self-expression'. If I write a poem<br />
                  about <del>ceratin</del> experiences I have had,I do so<del>,not bec</del> bec<del>ua</del><abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>use I think it<br />
                  <del>may</del>should be of interest and value to others<del>,not</del>: the fact that it has till now<br />
                  only been my exper<del>ei</del>ience is accidental. What the poet or any artist has to convey<br />
                  is a perception of a reality common to all,but seen from a unique perpsective,<br />
                  which it is his duty as well as his pleasure to share with others. To small<br />
                  truths as well as great,St Augustine's words apply.
               </p><p>
                  The truth is neither mine nor his nor another's;but belongs<br />
                  to us all whom Thou callest to partake of it: warning us<br />
                  terribly,not to account it private to ourselves,lest we be<br />
                  deprived of it.
               </p><p>
                  Then the second impulse to artistic fabrication is the desire to transcend<br />
                  our mortality,by making objects which,unlike ourselves,are not subject to<br />
                  natural death,but can remain <del>permantly</del> permanently 'on hand' in the world,<br />
                  long after we and our society have perished.<br />
                  Every genuine work of art,I believe,exhibits two qualities,Nowness and<br />
                  Permanence. By Nowness I mean the quality which enables an art-historian<br />
                  to date a work,at least,approximately. If,for example,one listens to<br />
                  a composition by Palestrina and one by Mozart,one knows immediately that,<br />
                  quite aside from their artistic merits,Palestrina must have lived earlier<br />
                  than Mozart: he could not possibly have written as he did after Mozart.<br />
                  By <del>p</del>Perman<del>a</del>ence,I mean  that the work continues to have relevance and<br />
                  importance lo<abbr title="unclear">m</abbr>g after its creator is dead. In the history of Art,unlike<br />
                  the history of Science,no genuine work of art is made obsolete by a<br />
                  later work. Past science is of interest only to the historian of science,not<br />
                  to what scientists are doing at this moment. Past works of art,on the<br />
                  other hand,are of the utmost importance to the contemporary <del>praticioner.</del><br />
                  practic<del>o</del>t<del>o</del>neroner. Every artist tries to produce something new,but in the hope<br />
                  that,in time,it will take its <del></del>proper place in the tradition of his art.<br />
                  And he cannot produce anything significantly original unless he knows<br />
                  well what has <del>been</del> already been done<abbr title="unclear">;</abbr>w<del>ithout</del>,that is to say ,<del>even in</del> he cannot<br />
                  'rebel' against the past without having a profound reverence for it.

                  In my own case,for example,I know how much I owe to Anglo-Saxon and<br />
                  Medie<del>av</del>val Poetry.<br />
                  When I <del>reveiw</del> review the contemporary artistic scene,<del>I</del><abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>t strikes me how<br />
                  <del>extraorinary</del> extraordinarily fortunate men like Stravinsky,Picasso,Eliot,<br />
                  etc,that is,those persons we think of as the founders of 'modern' art,<br />
                  were in being born when they were,so that they came to manhood before<br />
                  I9I4. Until the <del>Fis </del> First World War,western society was still pretty much<br />
                  what it had been in the nineteenth century. This meant that for these artists,<br />
                  the felt need to create something new arose from an artistic imperative,<br />
                  not a <del>histroi</del> historic imperative. No one asked himself:"What is the proper<br />
                  kind of music to compose or picture to paint or poem to write in the year<br />
                  I9I2.?"  Secondly,their <del>audiences</del> contemporary audiences  were mostly<br />
                  cons<del>r</del>ervative,but honestly so.  Those,for instance,who were scandalised by<br />
                  Le Sacre du Printemps,may seem to us now to have been old <del>fgi</del> fogies,but<br />
                  their reaction was genuine. They did not say to themselves:"Times have<br />
                  changed and we must change with them in order <del>to be up to date." </del> not to<br />
                  be left behind."<br />
                  Here are a few statements by Stravinsky to <del>whcih</del> which the young,<del>where</del><del>where</del>whether<br />
                  artists or critics would do well to listen and <del>pknde </del> ponder over.
               </p><p>
                  In my youth the new music grew out of,and in reaction to,traditions,<br />
                  whereas it appears to be evolving to-day as much from social needs<br />
                  as interior artistic ones...The status of <del>the</del> new music as a<br />
                  category is another incomparable. It had none at all in my early<br />
                  years,being in fact categorically opposed,and often with real<br />
                  hostility. But the unsuccess of composers o<del>n</del>f my generation at<br />
                  least kept them from trading on success,and our unsuccess may have<br />
                  been less insidious than the automatic superlatives which nowadays<br />
                  kill the new by absorbing it t<del>i</del>o death.<br />
                  ***
               </p><p>
                  The use of the new hardware naturally appears to the new musician<br />
                  as "historically imperative"; but music is made out of musical<br />
                  imperatives,and the awareness of historical processes is probably<br />
                  best left to future and different kinds of wage-earners.<br />
                  ***

                  In times,like our own,of rapid social change and political crisis,there i<abbr title="unclear">s</abbr><br />
                  always a danger of confusing the principles governing political action and<br />
                  those governing artistic fabrication.  The most important of such confus<del>u</del>ions<br />
                  are thr<del>r</del>ee.<br />
                  Firstly,one may come to think of artistic fabrication as <del>s</del><abbr title="unclear">a</abbr> f<del>rom</del>orm of politic<abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>l<br />
                  action. Every citizen,<del>artists</del>poets includ<del>i</del>ed,has a duty to be politically 'engagé',<br />
                  that is,to <del>feel</del> play a responsible part in seeing that the society of which<br />
                  he is a member shall function properly and improve. But the poet,qua poet,<br />
                  has only one political function. Since lang<del>i</del>uage is his medium,it is his duty,<br />
                  by his own example,to defend his <del>motehher</del>mothermother-tongue against corruption by demagogues,<br />
                  journalists,the mass-media etc. As Karl Kraus<del>s</del> said:"Die Sprache ist die <del>Muuet</del><br />
                  Mutter,nicht das Magd,des <del>d</del> <del>g</del>Gedankens",and when language loses its meaning,<br />
                  its <del>palce</del> place is taken by violence. Of course,the poet may use political and<br />
                  social events as subject-matter for poems - they are as much a part of human<br />
                  experience as love or nature - but he must never imagine that his poems have<br />
                  the power to affect the course of history. The political and social history<br />
                  of Europe w<abbr title="unclear">o</abbr>uld be what it <del>ahs</del> has been if Dante,Shakepeare,Goethe,Micha<del>le</del>el<br />
                  Angelo,Tit<del>ai</del>ian,Mozart,Beethoven,e<del>y</del>tc,<del>ahd</del> had never existed.

                  detailed journalistic rapportage of the facts. The Arts are powerless.<br />
                  The second confusion,of which Plato is the most famous example,is to take<br />
                  arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication as the model for a good society. <del>The aim of any artist  </del><br />
                  Such a model,if put into practice,is bound to produce a tyrrany. The aim of<br />
                  the artist<del>s</del> is to produce an object which is complete and will endure without<br />
                  change. <del>A</del> In the 'city' of a poem,there are always the same inhabitants doing<br />
                  exactly the same jobs for ever. A society which was really like a good poem,<br />
                  embodying the aesthetic virtues of order,economy and subordination of the detail<br />
                  to the whole,would be a nightmare of horror for,given the historical reality of<br />
                  actual men,such a society could only come into being through selective breeding,<br />
                  ex<del>y</del>termination  of the physically and mentally unfit,absolute obedience to<br />
                  its <del>D</del>director,a alrge slave cla<del>a</del>ss kept out of sight in <del>f</del>cellars and the<br />
                  strictest censure<del>e</del>ship of the Arts,forbidding anything to be said which <del>was</del> is<br />
                  <del>not</del> out of keeping with the official 'line.'<br />
                  The third confusion,typical of our western <del>civilisat</del> 'free' <del>soncietis</del><br />
                  societies at this time,is the opposite of Plato's,namely to take political<br />
                  act<del>u</del>ion as the model for arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication. Political action is a necessity,<br />
                  that is to say,a<del>y</del>t very moment something has to be done,and <del>politicla</del> it<br />
                  is momentary - action at this moment is immeiately followed by another action<br />
                  at the next.  Artistic fabrication,on the other hand,is <del>voluntarily</del> voluntary-<br />
                  the alternative to one work of art can be no work of art - and the artistic<br />
                  object is permanent,that is to say,immune to historical change. The attempt<br />
                  to model arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication o<del>s</del>n political action can therefore,only<br />
                  reduce it to momentary <del>(h </del> a<del>d</del>nd arbitrary 'happenings',a conformism with<br />
                  the tyrrany of the immediate moment which is far more enslaving and<br />
                  destructive of integrity than any conformism with past tradition.

               </p><p>
                  What then,can the Arts do for us? In my opi<del>o</del>nion,they can do two things.<br />
                  They can,as Dr Johns<del>t</del>on said,'enable us a little better to enjoy life or a<br />
                  little better to <del>enjoy</del>endure it". And,<del>becaase</del> because they are objects <del>permant</del><br />
                  permanently on hand in the world,they are the chief means by which the <del>lvi</del><br />
                  living are able to break bread with the dead,and,without a communication<br />
                  with the dead,I do not believe that a fully human civilised life is possible.<br />
                  Perhaps,too,in our age,the mere making of a work of art is itself a<br />
                  political act. So long as artists exist,making what they please or think<br />
                  they ought to make,even if <del>the worlks</del> their wor<del>l</del>ks are not terribly good,they<br />
                  remind the Management of something managers need to be reminded of,namely,<br />
                  that the managed are people with faces,not anonymous numbers,that Homo<br />
                  Laborans is also Homo Ludens.<br />
                  And now,I hope those of you who know no English will forgive me i<del>s</del>f<br />
                  I conclude<del>d</del> these remarks with a light poem of my own,entitled<br />
                  Doggerel <del>of</del> by a Senior Citizen.

                  At this p<del>in</del>oint,a little digression on the subject of 'free' verse,which<br />
                  seems now to be almost universal among young poets. Though excellent<br />
                  examples,the poems of D.H.Lawrence,for example,exist,i<del>n my opinion </del>they are,<abbr title="unclear">in</abbr> my opinio<abbr title="unclear">n</abbr><br />
                  the exception,not the rule. The great virtue of formal metrical rules is<br />
                  that they forbid automatic <del>reposnse</del> resp<del>i</del>onses and,by forcing the <del>piet</del> poet<br />
                  to have second thoughts,free <del>f</del>him f<del>or</del>rom the fetters of self. All too often,the<br />
                  result of not having a fixed form to be true to,is a self-indulgence which in<br />
                  the detached reader can only cause boredom. Further,in my exper<del>ei</del>ience ,contrary<br />
                  to what one might exp<del>s</del>ect,the <del>writers o</del> free-verse poets sound much more<br />

                  it does not,it would seem,make for originality.

                  Dear Stella·
                  You're an angel. I have to deliver this
                  in Neulengbach on Sunday, June 14th.
                  In case your dictionary doesn't give it, the
                  German for the technical word buddle (page I, near
                  bottom) is Erzwaschtrog .
                  I hope there is an equivalent German euphemism
                  for "te Senior Citizen.",
                  If there is a special honary title of adress
                  for a Landeshauptman,please supply.
                  love
                  Wystan
                  P_S. Adit = Stollen.
                  Concentrating Mill is,I <del>suspec</del>tGuess, though I may
                  be wrong , Vereinigungmühle .

               </p><p class="yes-index">
                  Sehr vee<del>rh</del>hrter Herr Landeshauptmann,meine Damen und Herren:
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally. I do so,
                  not out of vanity,but bec<del>ua</del>ause  I do <del>j</del>not wish to give the impression that I
                  am attempting to lay down absolute laws which are valid for all. I give you my
                  experiences as a poet,in the hope that you will be able to compare the<del>,</del>m with
                  yours<del>own</del>,and form your own judgment about them.
                  Most of what I <del>o</del>know about the writing of poetry,or at least about the kind I
                  am interested in writing,I discovered long before I took any interest in poetry
                  itself.
                  Between the ages of six and twelve,I spent a great many of my waking hours in
                  the fab<del>o</del>rication of a private secondary sacred world,the basic elements of which
                  were <del>atO</del> a) a limestone landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the
                  North of England and b) an industry - lead-mining.
                  It is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred world was autistic -
                  that is to say,I had no wish to share it with others no<del>t</del>r could I have done so.
                  However,though constructed for and inhabited by myself alone,I needed the help of
                  others,my parents in particular,in collecting its basic materials; others had to
                  procure for me the necessary text-books on geology and machinery,maps,catalog<del>i</del>ues,
                  guide-books and photographs,and,when occasion offered<del>,to</del> ta<del>l</del>ke me down real mines,
                  tasks which they performed with unfailing patience and generosity.
                  From this activity,I learned certain principles which I was later to find applied
                  to all artistic fabrication. First,whatever other elements it may include,the
                  initial impulse to create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by
                  encounters,in the Primary World,with sacred beings or events.  This feeling of awe
                  is an imperative,that is to´ say,one is not free to choose the object or the event
                  that arouses it. Though every work of art is a secondary world,it cannot be
                  constructed ex nihilo,but is a selection from and a recombination of the contents of
                  the Primary World. Even the 'purest' poem,in the French Symboliste sense,is
                  made of words which are not the poet's private property,but the communal creation
                  of the linguistic group to whom he belongs,so that their meaning can be looked up
                  in a dictionary.
                  Secondly,in constructing my private world,I discovere<del>s</del>d that,though this was
                  a game,or rather precisely because it was a game - that is to say,not a necessity
                  like eating or sleeping,but something I was free to do or not as I chose - it
                  could not be played without rules. Absolute freedom is meaningless: freedom can
                  only be realised in a choice between alternati<del>c</del>ves. A secondary world,be it a poem,
                  or a game of football or bridge,must be as much a world of law as the Primary,the
                  only difference being that in the world of games one is free to decide what its
                  laws shall be. But to all games as to real life,Goethe's lines apply.

                  As regards my particu<del>al</del>lar lead-mining world,I decided,or rather,without conscious
                  decision I instinctively felt,that I must impose two restrictions upon my freedom
                  of fantasy. In choosing what objects were to be included,I was free to select this
                  and reject that,on condition that both were real objects in the Primary World,to
                  choose,for example,between two kinds of water-turbine,which could be found in a
                  text-book  on mining machinery or a manufacturer's catalogue: but I was not free
                  to invent one.  In deciding how my world was to function,I <del>was </del> could choose between
                  t<del>e</del>wo practical possibilit<del>es</del>ies  - a mine can be drained either by an adit or a pump -
                  but physic<del></del>al impossibili<del>es</del>ties and magic means were forbidden. <del>T</del>When I say forbidden,
                  I mean that I felt,in some obscure way,that they were morally forbidden. Then there
                  came a day when the moral issue became quite conscious. As I was planning my
                  Platonic Idea of a concentrating-mill,I ran into difficulties. I had to choose
                  between two types of a cer<del>at</del>tain machine for separating the slimes,called a buddle.
                  One type I found more sacred or '<del>beatiuful</del> beautiful',but the other type was,I
                  knew from my reading,the more efficient. At this point I realised that it was my
                  moral duty to sacrifice my <del>aethetic</del> aesthetic preference to reality or truth.

                  When,later,I began to write poetry’I found that,for me,at least,the same
                  obligation was binding. That is to say,I cannot accept the do<del>s</del>ctrine that,in
                  poetry,there is a 'suspension of belief<del>e</del>'. A poet must never make a statement
                  simply because it sounds poetically exciting: he must also bel<del>ei</del>ieve it to be
                  true. This does not mean,of course,that one can only appreciate a poet whose
                  beliefs happen to co-incide with one's own. It does mean,however,that one must
                  <del>n</del>be convinced that the poet really believ<del></del>es what he says,however odd <del>that</del> the
                  belief may seem to oneself.
                  Between constructing a private <del>fantsa</del>yfantasy world for oneself alone
                  and writing poetry,there is,of course,a profound difference. A <del>fanatsy</del>
                  fantasy world exists only in the head of its creator: a poem is a public
                  verbal object intended to be read and enjoyed by others. To become conscious
                  of others is to become conscious of historical time/. in various ways. The
                  contents of a poem are necessarily past <del>expereinces</del> experiences,and the goal of
                  a poem is <del>necessaily</del> necessarily in the future,since it cannot be read until
                  it has been written. Again,to write a poem is to engage in an activity which
                  human beings have practised for centuries. If one asks why human beings
                  make poems or paint pictures or compose music,I can see two possible answers.
                  Firstly all the artistic media are forms of an activity pecul<del></del>iar to human
                  beings,namely,Personal Speech. Many animals have impersonal codes of
                  communications,visual,olfactory,auditory signals,b<del></del>y which they convey to
                  other members of their species vital information about food,territory,sex,
                  the presence of <del>enmies</del> enemies etc,and in social animals like the bee,such
                  a code may be exceedingly comple<del>s</del>x. We,too,of course,often use words in the same
                  way,as when I ask a stranger the way to the railroad station. But when we
                  truly speak,we do something quite different. We <del>spak</del> speak as person to person
                  in order to disclose ourselves to others and share our exper<del>ei</del>iences with
                  them,not because we must,but becuase we enjoy doing so. This activity is
                  sometimes quite erroneously called 'self-expression'. If I write a poem
                  about <del>ceratin</del> experiences I have had,I do so<del>,not bec</del> bec<del>ua</del>ause I think it
                  <del>may</del>should be of interest and value to others<del>,not</del>: the fact that it has till now
                  only been my exper<del>ei</del>ience is accidental. What the poet or any artist has to convey
                  is a perception of a reality common to all,but seen from a unique perpsective,
                  which it is his duty as well as his pleasure to share with others. To small
                  truths as well as great,St Augustine's words apply.
               </p><p class="yes-index">
                  The truth is neither mine nor his nor another's;but belongs
                  to us all whom Thou callest to partake of it: warning us
                  terribly,not to account it private to ourselves,lest we be
                  deprived of it.
               </p><p class="yes-index">
                  Then the second impulse to artistic fabrication is the desire to transcend
                  our mortality,by making objects which,unlike ourselves,are not subject to
                  natural death,but can remain <del>permantly</del> permanently 'on hand' in the world,
                  long after we and our society have perished.
                  Every genuine work of art,I believe,exhibits two qualities,Nowness and
                  Permanence. By Nowness I mean the quality which enables an art-historian
                  to date a work,at least,approximately. If,for example,one listens to
                  a composition by Palestrina and one by Mozart,one knows immediately that,
                  quite aside from their artistic merits,Palestrina must have lived earlier

                  By <del>p</del>Perman<del>a</del>ence,I mean  that the work continues to have relevance and
                  importance lomg after its creator is dead. In the history of Art,unlike
                  the history of Science,no genuine work of art is made obsolete by a
                  later work. Past science is of interest only to the historian of science,not
                  to what scientists are doing at this moment. Past works of art,on the
                  other hand,are of the utmost importance to the contemporary <del>praticioner.</del>
                  practic<del>o</del>t<del>o</del>neroner. Every artist tries to produce something new,but in the hope
                  that,in time,it will take its <del></del>proper place in the tradition of his art.
                  And he cannot produce anything significantly original unless he knows
                  well what has <del>been</del> already been done;w<del>ithout</del>,that is to say ,<del>even in</del> he cannot
                  'rebel' against the past without having a profound reverence for it.

                  There are periods in history when <del>art</del> the arts develop uninterruptedly,
                  each generation building on the achievements of the previous generation.
                  There are other periods when radical breaks seem to be necessary. However,
                  <del>t</del>when they are,one will generally find that the 'radical' artist does not
                  <del>diswon</del> disown the past,but finds in works of a much earlier period or in
                  those of <del>anotehr</del> culture than his own,the clue as to what he should do now.
                  In my own case,for example,I know how much I owe to Anglo-Saxon and
                  Medie<del>av</del>val Poetry.
                  When I <del>reveiw</del> review the contemporary artistic scene,<del>I</del>it strikes me how
                  <del>extraorinary</del> extraordinarily fortunate men like Stravinsky,Picasso,Eliot,
                  etc,that is,those persons we think of as the founders of 'modern' art,
                  were in being born when they were,so that they came to manhood before
                  I9I4. Until the <del>Fis </del> First World War,western society was still pretty much
                  what it had been in the nineteenth century. This meant that for these artists,
                  the felt need to create something new arose from an artistic imperative,
                  not a <del>histroi</del> historic imperative. No one asked himself:"What is the proper
                  kind of music to compose or picture to paint or poem to write in the year
                  I9I2.?"  Secondly,their <del>audiences</del> contemporary audiences  were mostly
                  cons<del>r</del>ervative,but honestly so.  Those,for instance,who were scandalised by
                  Le Sacre du Printemps,may seem to us now to have been old <del>fgi</del> fogies,but
                  their reaction was genuine. They did not say to themselves:"Times have
                  changed and we must change with them in order <del>to be up to date." </del> not to
                  be left behind."
                  Here are a few statements by Stravinsky to <del>whcih</del> which the young,<del>where</del><del>where</del>whether
                  artists or critics would do well to listen and <del>pknde </del> ponder over.

                  In my youth the new music grew out of,and in reaction to,traditions,
                  whereas it appears to be evolving to-day as much from social needs
                  as interior artistic ones...The status of <del>the</del> new music as a
                  category is another incomparable. It had none at all in my early
                  years,being in fact categorically opposed,and often with real
                  hostility. But the unsuccess of composers o<del>n</del>f my generation at
                  least kept them from trading on success,and our unsuccess may have
                  been less insidious than the automatic superlatives which nowadays
                  kill the new by absorbing it t<del>i</del>o death.

                  The use of the new hardware naturally appears to the new musician
                  as "historically imperative"; but music is made out of musical
                  imperatives,and the awareness of historical processes is probably
                  best left to future and different kinds of wage-earners.

                  In times,like our own,of rapid social change and political crisis,there is
                  always a danger of confusing the principles governing political action and
                  those governing artistic fabrication.  The most important of such confus<del>u</del>ions
                  are thr<del>r</del>ee.
                  Firstly,one may come to think of artistic fabrication as <del>s</del>a f<del>rom</del>orm of political
                  action. Every citizen,<del>artists</del>poets includ<del>i</del>ed,has a duty to be politically 'engagé',
                  that is,to <del>feel</del> play a responsible part in seeing that the society of which
                  he is a member shall function properly and improve. But the poet,qua poet,
                  has only one political function. Since lang<del>i</del>uage is his medium,it is his duty,
                  by his own example,to defend his <del>motehher</del>mothermother-tongue against corruption by demagogues,
                  journalists,the mass-media etc. As Karl Kraus<del>s</del> said:"Die Sprache ist die <del>Muuet</del>
                  Mutter,nicht das Magd,des <del>d</del> <del>g</del>Gedankens",and when language loses its meaning,
                  its <del>palce</del> place is taken by violence. Of course,the poet may use political and
                  social events as subject-matter for poems - they are as much a part of human
                  experience as love or nature - but he must never imagine that his poems have
                  the power to affect the course of history. The political and social history
                  of Europe would be what it <del>ahs</del> has been if Dante,Shakepeare,Goethe,Micha<del>le</del>el
                  Angelo,Tit<del>ai</del>ian,Mozart,Beethoven,e<del>y</del>tc,<del>ahd</del> had never existed.

                  detailed journalistic rapportage of the facts. The Arts are powerless.
                  The second confusion,of which Plato is the most famous example,is to take
                  arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication as the model for a good society. <del>The aim of any artist  </del>
                  Such a model,if put into practice,is bound to produce a tyrrany. The aim of
                  the artist<del>s</del> is to produce an object which is complete and will endure without
                  change. <del>A</del> In the 'city' of a poem,there are always the same inhabitants doing
                  exactly the same jobs for ever. A society which was really like a good poem,
                  embodying the aesthetic virtues of order,economy and subordination of the detail
                  to the whole,would be a nightmare of horror for,given the historical reality of
                  actual men,such a society could only come into being through selective breeding,
                  ex<del>y</del>termination  of the physically and mentally unfit,absolute obedience to
                  its <del>D</del>director,a alrge slave cla<del>a</del>ss kept out of sight in <del>f</del>cellars and the
                  strictest censure<del>e</del>ship of the Arts,forbidding anything to be said which <del>was</del> is
                  <del>not</del> out of keeping with the official 'line.'
                  The third confusion,typical of our western <del>civilisat</del> 'free' <del>soncietis</del>
                  societies at this time,is the opposite of Plato's,namely to take political
                  act<del>u</del>ion as the model for arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication. Political action is a necessity,
                  that is to say,a<del>y</del>t very moment something has to be done,and <del>politicla</del> it
                  is momentary - action at this moment is immeiately followed by another action
                  at the next.  Artistic fabrication,on the other hand,is <del>voluntarily</del> voluntary-
                  the alternative to one work of art can be no work of art - and the artistic
                  object is permanent,that is to say,immune to historical change. The attempt
                  to model arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication o<del>s</del>n political action can therefore,only
                  reduce it to momentary <del>(h </del> a<del>d</del>nd arbitrary 'happenings',a conformism with
                  the tyrrany of the immediate moment which is far more enslaving and
                  destructive of integrity than any conformism with past tradition.

                  What then,can the Arts do for us? In my opi<del>o</del>nion,they can do two things.
                  They can,as Dr Johns<del>t</del>on said,'enable us a little better to enjoy life or a
                  little better to <del>enjoy</del>endure it". And,<del>becaase</del> because they are objects <del>permant</del>
                  permanently on hand in the world,they are the chief means by which the <del>lvi</del>
                  living are able to break bread with the dead,and,without a communication
                  with the dead,I do not believe that a fully human civilised life is possible.
                  Perhaps,too,in our age,the mere making of a work of art is itself a
                  political act. So long as artists exist,making what they please or think
                  they ought to make,even if <del>the worlks</del> their wor<del>l</del>ks are not terribly good,they
                  remind the Management of something managers need to be reminded of,namely,
                  that the managed are people with faces,not anonymous numbers,that Homo
                  Laborans is also Homo Ludens.
                  And now,I hope those of you who know no English will forgive me i<del>s</del>f
                  I conclude<del>d</del> these remarks with a light poem of my own,entitled
                  Doggerel <del>of</del> by a Senior Citizen.

                  At this p<del>in</del>oint,a little digression on the subject of 'free' verse,which
                  seems now to be almost universal among young poets. Though excellent
                  examples,the poems of D.H.Lawrence,for example,exist,i<del>n my opinion </del>they are,in my opinion
                  the exception,not the rule. The great virtue of formal metrical rules is
                  that they forbid automatic <del>reposnse</del> resp<del>i</del>onses and,by forcing the <del>piet</del> poet
                  to have second thoughts,free <del>f</del>him f<del>or</del>rom the fetters of self. All too often,the
                  result of not having a fixed form to be true to,is a self-indulgence which in
                  the detached reader can only cause boredom. Further,in my exper<del>ei</del>ience ,contrary
                  to what one might exp<del>s</del>ect,the <del>writers o</del> free-verse poets sound much more
                  like each other than those who write in fixed forms. Whatever freedom may do,
                  it does not,it would seem,make for originality.

                  Sehr vee<del>rh</del>hrter Herr Landeshauptman<abbr title="unclear">n,</abbr>meine Damen und Herren:<br />
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally. I do so,<br />
                  not out of vanity,but bec<del>ua</del>ause  I do <del>j</del>not wish to give the impression that I<br />
                  am attempting to lay down absolute laws which are valid for all. I give you my<br />
                  experience<abbr title="unclear">s</abbr> as a poet,in the hope that you will be able to compare the<del>,</del>m with<br />
                  yours<del>own</del>,and form your own judgment about them.<br />
                  Most of what I <del>o</del>know about the writing of poetry,or at least about the kind I<br />
                  am interested in writing,I discovered long before I took any interest in poetry<br />
                  itself.<br />
                  Between the ages of six and twelve,I spent a great many of my waking hours in<br />
                  the fab<del>o</del>rication of a private secondary sacred world,the basic elements of which<br />
                  were <del>atO</del> a) a limestone landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the<br />
                  North of England and b) an industry - lead-mining.<br />
                  It is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred world was autistic -<br />
                  that is to say,I had no wish to share it with others no<del>t</del>r could I have done so.<br />
                  However,though constructed for and inhabited by myself alone,I needed the help of<br />
                  others,my parents in particular,in collecting its basic materials; others had to<br />
                  procure for me the necessary text-books on geology and machinery,maps,catalog<del>i</del>ues,<br />
                  guide-books and photographs,and,when occasion offered<del>,to</del> ta<del>l</del>ke me down real mines,<br />
                  tasks which they performed with unfailing patience and generosity.<br />
                  From this activity,I learned certain principles which I was later to find applied<br />
                  to all artistic fabrication. First,whatever other elements it may include,the<br />
                  initial impulse to create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by<br />
                  encounters,in the Primary World,with sacred beings or events.  This feeling of awe<br />
                  is an imperative,that is to<abbr title="unclear">´</abbr> say,one is not free to choose the object or the event<br />
                  that arouses it. Though every work of art is a secondary world,it cannot be<br />
                  constructed ex nihilo,but is a selection from and a recombination of the contents of<br />
                  the Primary World. Even the 'purest' poem,in the French Symboliste sense,is<br />
                  made of words which are not the poet's private property,but the communal creation<br />
                  of the linguistic group to whom he belongs,so that their meaning can be looked up<br />
                  in a dictionary.<br />
                  Secondly,in constructing my private world,I discovere<del>s</del>d that,though this was<br />
                  a game,or rather precisely because it was a game - that is to say,not a necessity<br />
                  like eating or sleeping,but something I was free to do or not as I chose - it<br />
                  could not be played without rules. Absolute freedom is meaningless: freedom can<br />
                  only be realised in a choice between alternati<del>c</del>ves. A secondary world,be it a poem,<br />
                  or a game of football or bridge,must be as much a world of law as the Primary,the<br />
                  only difference being that in the world of games one is free to decide what its<br />
                  laws shall be. But to all games as to real life,Goethe's lines apply.

                  As regards my particu<del>al</del>l<abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>r lead-mining world,I decided,or rather,without conscious<br />
                  decision I instinctively felt,that I must impose two restrictions upon my freedom<br />
                  of fantasy. In choosing what objects were to be included,I was free to select this<br />
                  and reject that,on condition that both were real objects in the Primary World,to<br />
                  choose,for example,between two kinds of water-turbine,which could be found in a<br />
                  text-book  on mining machinery or a manufacturer's catalogue: but I was not free<br />
                  to invent one.  In deciding how my world was to function,I <del>was </del> could choose between<br />
                  t<del>e</del>wo practical possibilit<del>es</del>ies  - a mine can be drained either by an adit or a pump -<br />
                  but physic<del></del>al impossibili<del>es</del>ties and magic means were forbidden. <del>T</del>When I say forbidden,<br />
                  I mean that I felt,in some obscure way,that they were morally forbidden. Then there<br />
                  came a day when the moral issue became quite conscious. As I was planning my<br />
                  Platonic Idea of a concentrating-mill,I ran into difficulties. I had to choose<br />
                  between two types of a cer<del>at</del>tain machine for separating the sli<abbr title="unclear">m</abbr>es,called a buddle.<br />
                  One type I found more sacred or '<del>beatiuful</del> beautiful',but the other type was,I<br />
                  knew from my reading,the more efficient. At this point I realised that it was my<br />
                  moral duty to sacrifice my <del>aethetic</del> aesthetic preference to reality or truth.

               </p><p>
                  When,later,I began to write poetry’I found that,for me,at least,the same<br />
                  obligation was binding. That is to say,I cannot accept the do<del>s</del>ctrine that,in<br />
                  poetry,there is a 'suspension of belief<del>e</del>'. A poet must never make a statement<br />
                  simply because it sounds poetically exciting: he must also bel<del>ei</del>ieve it to be<br />
                  true. This does not mean,of course,that one can only appreciate a poet whose<br />
                  beliefs happen to co-incide with one's own. It does mean,however,that one must<br />
                  <del>n</del>be convinced that the poet really believ<del></del>es what he says,however odd <del>that</del> the<br />
                  belief may seem to oneself.<br />
                  Between constructing a private <del>fantsa</del>yfantasy world for oneself alone<br />
                  and writing poetry,there is,of course,a profound difference. A <del>fanatsy</del><br />
                  fantasy world exists only in the head of its creator: a poem is a public<br />
                  verbal object intended to be read and enjoyed by others. To become conscious<br />
                  of others is to become conscious of historical time/. in various ways. The<br />
                  contents of a poem are necessarily past <del>expereinces</del> experiences,and the goal of<br />
                  a poem is <del>necessaily</del> necessarily in the future,since it cannot be read until<br />
                  it has been written. Again<abbr title="unclear">,</abbr>to write a poem is to engage in an activity which<br />
                  human beings have practised for centuries. If one asks why human beings<br />
                  make poems or paint pictures or compose music,I can see two possible answers.<br />
                  Firstly all the artistic media are forms of an activity pecul<del></del>iar to human<br />
                  beings,namely,Personal Speech. Many animals have impersonal codes of<br />
                  communications,visual,olfactory,auditory signals,b<del></del>y which they convey to<br />
                  other members of their species vital information about food,territory,sex,<br />
                  the presence of <del>enmies</del> enemies etc,and in social animals like the bee,such<br />
                  a code may be exceedingly comple<del>s</del>x. We,too,of course,often use words in the same<br />
                  way,as when I ask a stranger the way to the railroad station. But when we<br />
                  truly speak,we do something quite different. We <del>spak</del> speak as person to person<br />
                  in order to disclose ourselves to others and share our exper<del>ei</del><abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>ences with<br />
                  them,not because we must,but becuase we enjoy doing so. This activity is<br />
                  sometimes quite erroneously called 'self-expression'. If I write a poem<br />
                  about <del>ceratin</del> experiences I have had,I do so<del>,not bec</del> bec<del>ua</del><abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>use I think it<br />
                  <del>may</del>should be of interest and value to others<del>,not</del>: the fact that it has till now<br />
                  only been my exper<del>ei</del>ience is accidental. What the poet or any artist has to convey<br />
                  is a perception of a reality common to all,but seen from a unique perpsective,<br />
                  which it is his duty as well as his pleasure to share with others. To small<br />
                  truths as well as great,St Augustine's words apply.
               </p><p>
                  The truth is neither mine nor his nor another's;but belongs<br />
                  to us all whom Thou callest to partake of it: warning us<br />
                  terribly,not to account it private to ourselves,lest we be<br />
                  deprived of it.
               </p><p>
                  Then the second impulse to artistic fabrication is the desire to transcend<br />
                  our mortality,by making objects which,unlike ourselves,are not subject to<br />
                  natural death,but can remain <del>permantly</del> permanently 'on hand' in the world,<br />
                  long after we and our society have perished.<br />
                  Every genuine work of art,I believe,exhibits two qualities,Nowness and<br />
                  Permanence. By Nowness I mean the quality which enables an art-historian<br />
                  to date a work,at least,approximately. If,for example,one listens to<br />
                  a composition by Palestrina and one by Mozart,one knows immediately that,<br />
                  quite aside from their artistic merits,Palestrina must have lived earlier<br />
                  than Mozart: he could not possibly have written as he did after Mozart.<br />
                  By <del>p</del>Perman<del>a</del>ence,I mean  that the work continues to have relevance and<br />
                  importance lo<abbr title="unclear">m</abbr>g after its creator is dead. In the history of Art,unlike<br />
                  the history of Science,no genuine work of art is made obsolete by a<br />
                  later work. Past science is of interest only to the historian of science,not<br />
                  to what scientists are doing at this moment. Past works of art,on the<br />
                  other hand,are of the utmost importance to the contemporary <del>praticioner.</del><br />
                  practic<del>o</del>t<del>o</del>neroner. Every artist tries to produce something new,but in the hope<br />
                  that,in time,it will take its <del></del>proper place in the tradition of his art.<br />
                  And he cannot produce anything significantly original unless he knows<br />
                  well what has <del>been</del> already been done<abbr title="unclear">;</abbr>w<del>ithout</del>,that is to say ,<del>even in</del> he cannot<br />
                  'rebel' against the past without having a profound reverence for it.

                  There are periods in history when <del>art</del> the arts develop uninterruptedly,<br />
                  each generation building on the achievements of the previous generation.<br />
                  There are other periods when radical breaks seem to be necessary. However,<br />
                  <del>t</del>when they are,one will generally find that the 'radical' artist does not<br />
                  <del>diswon</del> disown the past,but finds in works of a much earlier period or in<br />
                  those of <del>anotehr</del> culture than his own,the clue as to what he should do now.<br />
                  In my own case,for example,I know how much I owe to Anglo-Saxon and<br />
                  Medie<del>av</del>val Poetry.<br />
                  When I <del>reveiw</del> review the contemporary artistic scene,<del>I</del><abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>t strikes me how<br />
                  <del>extraorinary</del> extraordinarily fortunate men like Stravinsky,Picasso,Eliot,<br />
                  etc,that is,those persons we think of as the founders of 'modern' art,<br />
                  were in being born when they were,so that they came to manhood before<br />
                  I9I4. Until the <del>Fis </del> First World War,western society was still pretty much<br />
                  what it had been in the nineteenth century. This meant that for these artists,<br />
                  the felt need to create something new arose from an artistic imperative,<br />
                  not a <del>histroi</del> historic imperative. No one asked himself:"What is the proper<br />
                  kind of music to compose or picture to paint or poem to write in the year<br />
                  I9I2.?"  Secondly,their <del>audiences</del> contemporary audiences  were mostly<br />
                  cons<del>r</del>ervative,but honestly so.  Those,for instance,who were scandalised by<br />
                  Le Sacre du Printemps,may seem to us now to have been old <del>fgi</del> fogies,but<br />
                  their reaction was genuine. They did not say to themselves:"Times have<br />
                  changed and we must change with them in order <del>to be up to date." </del> not to<br />
                  be left behind."<br />
                  Here are a few statements by Stravinsky to <del>whcih</del> which the young,<del>where</del><del>where</del>whether<br />
                  artists or critics would do well to listen and <del>pknde </del> ponder over.
               </p><p>
                  In my youth the new music grew out of,and in reaction to,traditions,<br />
                  whereas it appears to be evolving to-day as much from social needs<br />
                  as interior artistic ones...The status of <del>the</del> new music as a<br />
                  category is another incomparable. It had none at all in my early<br />
                  years,being in fact categorically opposed,and often with real<br />
                  hostility. But the unsuccess of composers o<del>n</del>f my generation at<br />
                  least kept them from trading on success,and our unsuccess may have<br />
                  been less insidious than the automatic superlatives which nowadays<br />
                  kill the new by absorbing it t<del>i</del>o death.<br />

                  The use of the new hardware naturally appears to the new musician<br />
                  as "historically imperative"; but music is made out of musical<br />
                  imperatives,and the awareness of historical processes is probably<br />
                  best left to future and different kinds of wage-earners.<br />

                  In times,like our own,of rapid social change and political crisis,there i<abbr title="unclear">s</abbr><br />
                  always a danger of confusing the principles governing political action and<br />
                  those governing artistic fabrication.  The most important of such confus<del>u</del>ions<br />
                  are thr<del>r</del>ee.<br />
                  Firstly,one may come to think of artistic fabrication as <del>s</del><abbr title="unclear">a</abbr> f<del>rom</del>orm of politic<abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>l<br />
                  action. Every citizen,<del>artists</del>poets includ<del>i</del>ed,has a duty to be politically 'engagé',<br />
                  that is,to <del>feel</del> play a responsible part in seeing that the society of which<br />
                  he is a member shall function properly and improve. But the poet,qua poet,<br />
                  has only one political function. Since lang<del>i</del>uage is his medium,it is his duty,<br />
                  by his own example,to defend his <del>motehher</del>mothermother-tongue against corruption by demagogues,<br />
                  journalists,the mass-media etc. As Karl Kraus<del>s</del> said:"Die Sprache ist die <del>Muuet</del><br />
                  Mutter,nicht das Magd,des <del>d</del> <del>g</del>Gedankens",and when language loses its meaning,<br />
                  its <del>palce</del> place is taken by violence. Of course,the poet may use political and<br />
                  social events as subject-matter for poems - they are as much a part of human<br />
                  experience as love or nature - but he must never imagine that his poems have<br />
                  the power to affect the course of history. The political and social history<br />
                  of Europe w<abbr title="unclear">o</abbr>uld be what it <del>ahs</del> has been if Dante,Shakepeare,Goethe,Micha<del>le</del>el<br />

                  Such a model,if put into practice,is bound to produce a tyrrany. The aim of<br />
                  the artist<del>s</del> is to produce an object which is complete and will endure without<br />
                  change. <del>A</del> In the 'city' of a poem,there are always the same inhabitants doing<br />
                  exactly the same jobs for ever. A society which was really like a good poem,<br />
                  embodying the aesthetic virtues of order,economy and subordination of the detail<br />
                  to the whole,would be a nightmare of horror for,given the historical reality of<br />
                  actual men,such a society could only come into being through selective breeding,<br />
                  ex<del>y</del>termination  of the physically and mentally unfit,absolute obedience to<br />
                  its <del>D</del>director,a alrge slave cla<del>a</del>ss kept out of sight in <del>f</del>cellars and the<br />
                  strictest censure<del>e</del>ship of the Arts,forbidding anything to be said which <del>was</del> is<br />
                  <del>not</del> out of keeping with the official 'line.'<br />
                  The third confusion,typical of our western <del>civilisat</del> 'free' <del>soncietis</del><br />
                  societies at this time,is the opposite of Plato's,namely to take political<br />
                  act<del>u</del>ion as the model for arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication. Political action is a necessity,<br />
                  that is to say,a<del>y</del>t very moment something has to be done,and <del>politicla</del> it<br />
                  is momentary - action at this moment is immeiately followed by another action<br />
                  at the next.  Artistic fabrication,on the other hand,is <del>voluntarily</del> voluntary-<br />
                  the alternative to one work of art can be no work of art - and the artistic<br />
                  object is permanent,that is to say,immune to historical change. The attempt<br />
                  to model arti<del>t</del>stic fabrication o<del>s</del>n political action can therefore,only<br />
                  reduce it to momentary <del>(h </del> a<del>d</del>nd arbitrary 'happenings',a conformism with<br />
                  the tyrrany of the immediate moment which is far more enslaving and<br />
                  destructive of integrity than any conformism with past tradition.

               </p><p>
                  What then,can the Arts do for us? In my opi<del>o</del>nion,they can do two things.<br />
                  They can,as Dr Johns<del>t</del>on said,'enable us a little better to enjoy life or a<br />
                  little better to <del>enjoy</del>endure it". And,<del>becaase</del> because they are objects <del>permant</del><br />
                  permanently on hand in the world,they are the chief means by which the <del>lvi</del><br />
                  living are able to break bread with the dead,and,without a communication<br />
                  with the dead,I do not believe that a fully human civilised life is possible.<br />
                  Perhaps,too,in our age,the mere making of a work of art is itself a<br />
                  political act. So long as artists exist,making what they please or think<br />
                  they ought to make,even if <del>the worlks</del> their wor<del>l</del>ks are not terribly good,they<br />
                  remind the Management of something managers need to be reminded of,namely,<br />
                  that the managed are people with faces,not anonymous numbers,that Homo<br />
                  Laborans is also Homo Ludens.<br />
                  And now,I hope those of you who know no English will forgive me i<del>s</del>f<br />
                  I conclude<del>d</del> these remarks with a light poem of my own,entitled<br />
                  Doggerel <del>of</del> by a Senior Citizen.

                  At this p<del>in</del>oint,a little digression on the subject of 'free' verse,which<br />
                  seems now to be almost universal among young poets. Though excellent<br />
                  examples,the poems of D.H.Lawrence,for example,exist,i<del>n my opinion </del>they are,<abbr title="unclear">in</abbr> my opinio<abbr title="unclear">n</abbr><br />
                  the exception,not the rule. The great virtue of formal metrical rules is<br />
                  that they forbid automatic <del>reposnse</del> resp<del>i</del>onses and,by forcing the <del>piet</del> poet<br />
                  to have second thoughts,free <del>f</del>him f<del>or</del>rom the fetters of self. All too often,the<br />
                  result of not having a fixed form to be true to,is a self-indulgence which in<br />
                  the detached reader can only cause boredom. Further,in my exper<del>ei</del>ience ,contrary<br />
                  to what one might exp<del>s</del>ect,the <del>writers o</del> free-verse poets sound much more<br />
                  like each other than those who write in fixed forms. Whatever freedom may do,<br />
                  it does not,it would seem,make for originality.
