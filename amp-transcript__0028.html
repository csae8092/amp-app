                  In Retrospect.<br />
                  Since then the Auden industry has not been idle.  An<br />
                  excellent biography was published1 and <del>i</del>kn this the Austrian<br />
                  period was dealt with but not locally researched.  Edward<br />
                  Mendelson edited Auden´s early works and wrote superb commentaries.<br />
                  There has been a biography of Chester Kallman.  Writers of PhD<br />
                  theses have been out here and have shaken us up, particularly<br />
                  Michael O´Sullivan of Trinity College, Dublin who - not spea<abbr title="unclear">k</abbr>ing<br />
                  a word of German - organised a full-scale exhibition and an<br />
                  international symposium in Vienna.  The editor of this volume<br />
                  Peter Müller had brought Michael out to see me at Fri<del>d</del>eau in the<br />
                  preceding year;  now he came again, and after the closure,<br />
                  exhausted, he spent a long weekend in the country to recover.<br />
                  We dug out ancient files containing original Auden manuscripts,<br />
                  letters, personal notes and newspaper cuttings, and now we tried<br />
                  to winnow the wheat from the chaff.  After some general discussion<br />
                  it seemed to us all that there remain certain aspects of Auden´s<br />
                  life in Lower Austria which are not on record, or where they are,<br />
                  not from the worm´s eye view.  As an older man he was happier<br />
                  here than anywhere else:  he felt at home.  He was at Kirchstette<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  not only during the summer, <del>i</del>as is often said, but with<br />
                  interruptions for five months, depending on his engagements.<br />
                  In the course of these years he was still highly <del>productive</del><br />
                  creative.  So that it might, we thought, be of value to put some<br />
                  of those things on record which would otherwise be lost.  Not<br />
                  for the first time self<del>.</del>-criticism was expressed, but while doubts<br />
                  concerning self-importance<del>as</del>and sell-out of f<del>i</del>riendship were not<br />
                  entirely banished, the view prevailed that the local witness<br />
                  needs to be put on paper.  Scholarship is at work elsewhere;<br />
                  here a few appendices and footnotes are on offer.<br />
                  Auden´s opinions on biographies of creative artists in general<br />
                  were, as Humphrey Carpenter pointed out, highly contradictory.<br />
                  Again and again he said that the private life of poets and other<br />
                  people engaged in creative work is none of the public´s business<br />
                  but he also said<abbr title="unclear">:</abbr>´`The biography of an artist, if his life as a w<abbr title="unclear">hole</abbr><br />
                  was sufficiently interesting, is permissible, provided that the<br />
                  biographer and his readers realise that such an account throws no<br />
                  light whatsoever upon the artist´s work."  And "I do believe,<br />
                  however, that, more often than most people realise, <del>k</del>his works<br />
                  may throw light upon his life."

                  Carpenter´s book calls itself "a first biography", and the<br />
                  author expressly restricts his aims:  "It is not a work of literary<br />
                  criticism".  It may also be felt to lack an analysis of some<br />
                  fundamental questions:  about the depths of the poet´s personality,<br />
                  his "otherness" (to confine this to his homosexuality would be to<br />
                  oversimplify) and the basis of his all-important relationship<br />
                  with Chester Kallman.  As a star<del>it</del>ting point, "Early Auden"1 which<br />
                  presents an<del>s</del>d comments on the poetry, drama and prose up to 1939<br />
                  is most valuable, and Edward Mendelson will produce further works<br />
                  of scholarship.<br />
                  What would Wystan Auden say if he could read "Auden in Love"<br />
                  by Chester´s old coll<del>a</del>ege friend and last-minute stepmother Dorothy<br />
                  J. Farnon?2  In July 1985 the Sunday Times published a list of<br />
                  recommended holiday <del>books</del> reading.  The assessment of "Auden in<br />
                  Love" was a model of compression:  "emetic but compulsive".<br />
                  I more than once came up against Auden´s idée fixe about the<br />
                  irrelevance of the poet´s private self, and asked him one day:<br />
                  "So no rotting apples in the desk drawer?"  "No, no rotting apples<br />
                  "And if you have an attack of the trots and interrupt your work?"<br />
                  "That would make no difference at all."  Chester´s sole explanatio<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  was that it was "a tick like any other", and that in any case he<br />
                  was totally inconsistent.  Be that as it may, if the effect on the<br />
                  general public was judged as emetic, Auden´s nausea can be<br />
                  imagined.  All the same, it is a fascinating book, and for people<br />
                  who knew the two men only in <del>r</del>the later years of their lives, does thro<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  light on apparently conflicting phenomena and makes their actions,<br />
                  and Chester´s character in particular, more comprehensible.<br />
                  When Auden first met Kallman he was just 32 and already a poet<br />
                  with an established reputation, respected and even revered on<br />
                  many a campus.  Kallman was an 18 year old undergraduate,<br />
                  brilliant, beautiful, focal<del>l</del>point and leader of a crowd of young<br />
                  intellectuals of both sexes.  He was a Dorian Grey figure,<br />
                  sparkling<del>a</del>and damned, hero and victim, immature and over-ripe,<br />
                  sensitive and heartless, a man capable of loving and of being

                  loved but who was already - though Auden did not know it -<br />
                  add<del>di</del><abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>cted to promiscuity.  In literature and music his knowledge<br />
                  was, for his age, above average, but when important examinations<br />
                  loomed a kind of petulant mood would come over him and he would<br />
                  fail to appear.<br />
                  Chester never wanted to earn his living, and all his life he wa<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  supported financially by other people, particularly by Auden.<br />
                  He usually promptly lost what he was given because he was<br />
                  perpetually being robbed by se<del>ö</del>amen picked up on the wharfs of<br />
                  New York.  By one of them he was robbed of three months´ income<br />
                  in succession.  Or else he gave it away:  no matter what actually<br />
                  happened, the money left his pocket.<br />
                  The scene shifts to a flat in the Esslingasse in Vienna´s<br />
                  3rd District, where Kallman once spent the winter.  He gave a<br />
                  party one evening, and afterwards I took two or three of the men<br />
                  part of t<del>i</del>heir way home in my car.  When Chester told me later on<br />
                  that the m<del>s</del>an who, as it chanced, had been sitting beside me, had<br />
                  gone off with 2,000 schillings taken out of the pocket of a<br />
                  jacket hanging on the bedroom door, I could not know that this<br />
                  was not a mere incident but almost a matter of routine.  When,<br />
                  ultimately, he took with him to Athens 80,000 sch. in cash<br />
                  (proceeds of the sale of a building plot) and lost it all on the<br />
                  way, this mishap was almost a foregone conclusion.<br />
                  That the sexual relationship between Auden and Kallman<br />
                  ceased as far back as 19<del>5</del>41 is well known:  from that time on -<br />
                  there is evidence in the poetry - sex and love became, for Auden,<br />
                  t<del>o</del>wo separate matters.  He felt married to Chester (when he was<br />
                  not Mother) for the rest of his life, and he wrote that Chester<br />
                  was the only person who, emotionally and intellectually, was<br />
                  wholly indispensable to him.<br />
                  Like it or not, this statement has to be accepted with all<br />
                  the weight it carries.  It was never possible, even in the<br />
                  Austrian era, to keep Chester in purdah for long, and when ther<abbr title="unclear">e</abbr><br />
                  was a visitor from Athens at Hinterholz 6 there could be tensio<del></del>n.<br />
                  Auden gave orders to Yannis Boras in the abrupt tones of a<br />
                  colonial Englishman of yore speaking to the "boy", and when I<br />
                  asked one day at lu<del>c</del>nch: "Where is, er....?" he said with a

                  smirk of satisfaction: "I sent him up on to the roof to mend tiles."<br />
                  But fundamentally nothing had changed between them:  this explains<br />
                  <del>his</del>Auden´s intense anxiety over the death of Boras in a car accident in<br />
                  Lower Austria, and his fear communicated itself to me as I searched<br />
                  for Chester in Vienna.  It was nearly Christmas, what on earth<br />
                  would become of him, distraught and alone?  (He had in fact not<br />
                  go<del>en</del>ne to Austria after all, but had not let Auden know.) There<br />
                  followed the gloomy summer <del>l</del>of 1969 when Chester was sunk in deep<br />
                  depression while Wyśtan had a full work programme, and when he<br />
                  told me he could hardly think how Chester would get through the<br />
                  summer1this was indeed Mother speaking.<br />
                  What was it in Chester Kallman that made him so entirely<br />
                  indispensable to Auden?  Perhaps the question is impossible to<br />
                  answer;  some may hold it to be inadmissible, or attempts to find<br />
                  points of reference impertinent.  Others again may find the whole<br />
                  subject unappetising.  But to anyone with an interest in psycholog<abbr title="unclear">y</abbr><br />
                  in the processes of cre<del>w</del><abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>tivity in general and in those of Auden<br />
                  in particular, there is no way of getting round this essential<br />
                  relationship.  It may, after all, come to be seen as one of the<br />
                  most curious in the history of English literature.<br />
                  In their love of music, of opera above all, Kallma<del>n</del>nwas in<br />
                  the lead.  He was a minor poet who wrote because he needed to do s<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  but his output was slight.  Yet in many spheres which were of<br />
                  intense interest to Auden he had little, sometimes nothing to offe<abbr title="unclear">r:</abbr><br />
                  German literature (though Chester picked <del>i</del>up languages with uncomm<abbr title="unclear">o</abbr>n<br />

                  hension unerring), the history of cultures, religion and liturgy,<br />
                  translation.  When I was with them Wystan did not only most of the<br />
                  talking, but of the asking as well; his great charm lay in his<br />
                  alert interest in other people´s work, and he would draw one out<br />
                  on the odder backwaters of Austrian history.  This side of him com<abbr title="unclear">e</abbr>s<br />

                  afternoon, Kallman was silent.  Kallman lacked Auden´s sensitivit<abbr title="unclear">y</abbr><br />

                  lost his roots in Europe.<br />
                  On his own ground, operatic libretti, Chester Kallman was<br />
                  still in good running order, and when the Rake´s Progress was put<br />
                  on in Vienna he wrote a letter to Die Presse protesting sharply<br />
                  <del>over</del>against the cuts <del>which had been</del> made by the producer.  But of that<br />
                  conversational brilliance which old friends have described there<br />
                  was little sign.  A scene comes to mind: Auden was away, and Chester<br />
                  asked me to meet him for lunch at a restaurant off the Kärntner-<br />
                  strasse.  A young man whose background clearly lay somewhere<br />
                  within the crime belt near the Prater was with him, and soon the<br />
                  youth <del></del>sand I were engrossed in conversation, while Chester, feeling<br />
                  out of it, sulked.  Immediately after coffee it seemed best to<br />
                  leave them.  Chester´s intelligence and wit had not deserted him<br />
                  but they had too little scope, and, perhaps owing to his carp-like<br />
                  appearance, he was liable to be underestimated.  He was good-natured,<br />
                  in course of time even affectionate, hospitable and amusing.  He<br />
                  looked after Auden devotedly and we know that he was able to banish<br />
                  Auden´s loneliness as no one else could.  His misfortune was that<br />
                  he lacked those qualities which Auden possessed and which decide<br />
                  between success and failure.<br />
                  It cannot, all the same, have been easy living on a long-term<br />
                  basis with Auden in New Yo<del>r</del>wk while attempting, even though<br />
                  fitfully, to develop his own personality and talents.  Putting up with Auden´s<br />
                  fads, his insistence on punctuality and the rigid routine was one<br />
                  thing;  to grow up, to mature in the shadow of this oversized tree<br />
                  was another.  There was not enough light.  So he fled, but without<br />
                  Mother there was no way he could live at all.<br />
                  It is essentia<del>sl</del>l, in the light of what happened later on, to<br />
                  remember Auden´s generosity.  His biographer mentioned the two boys<br />
                  whose further education was financed by Auden:  I can confirm this<br />
                  as we lived next door to them for a few years.  They were the sons of<br />
                  an artist;  both made rapid careers in industrial management.  But<br />
                  there were other examples.  Wyst<del>s</del><abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>n had telephoned and asked me to<br />
                  meet him and Chester at the Operncafé - the much-missed café-<br />
                  restaurant next to the Opera, now a car salesroom.  They were waiting<br />
                  for Balanchine to join them after the performance, but we waited in<br />
                  vain and fi<del>kn</del><abbr title="unclear">na</abbr>lly gave up and went home.  There was a fourth at our<br />
                  table, a silent young man who, Chester said in an undertone, was<br />
                  a student of technology and Wyst<del>sa</del><abbr title="unclear">an</abbr> was helping with his studies.

                  to lend the house to a Czech refugee and his wife.  By mid-<br />

               </p><p>
                  Dear Stella, Got back from Oxford yesterday and found your<br />
                  letter waiting.  1) I think I ought to take the couple in,<br />
                  but I m<del>k</del>ust leave it to you to decide whether they are O.K.<br />
                  If they are, all rooms, including my study (which can´t be<br />
                  heated) are open to them.  2)  How m<del>ku</del>uch money will they need<br />
                  to keep going?  And how shall I make the arrangements for<br />
                  payment.  3) Will they be able to find work or emigrate<br />
                  before I return in April, when I´m afraid there will not<br />
                  be room for them?  4) I´m worried about how they will get<br />
                  gas cylinders for cooking from Neulengbach, since, presumably,<br />
                  they have no car.  I expect someone in the village will help.<br />
                  5)  If and when they come, I must know in advance so that I<br />
                  can write a note to the Burgom<del>a</del>eister..." (sic).
               </p><p>
                  In the end nothing came of <del>ö</del><abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>t, but the letter is quoted<br />
                  here because it is so characteristic;  the follow-up is even<br />
                  more so.

                  Dear Stella,<br />
                  Many thanks for your letter.  Of course,<br />
                  selfishly, I´m rather relieved.  How horrid<br />
                  one is!<br />
                  The U.S. is grim.<br />
                  Love,<br />

                  Great generosity (these facts, even separately, are known<br />
                  to no more than two or three people) <del>ed  existed</del>combined in Auden´s<br />
                  character quite readily with his legendary stinginess in the<br />
                  small things of everyday life such as stamps or cigarettes.<br />
                  "Life" magazine, he told me one day with a beaming smile, had<br />
                  just paid him 5,000 dolla<del>sr</del><abbr title="unclear">r</abbr>s for an article.  "I´m thinking<br />
                  of building on a diningroom."  "Very good idea" I said,<br />
                  "but for a start I shall smoke your cigarettes for the rest of<br />
                  the afternoon."  I very much doubt whether I did.  On the other<br />

                  know how you propose to pay for your treatment.  No, he said,<br />
                  he didn´t really need anything and Chester would arrive shortly,<br />
                  but he was running out of gin.   If I´d be an angel and ring<br />
                  up Wild on the Neuer Markt and ask them to send a few bottles out -<br />
                  he told me the brand name - that would be splendid.<br />
                  When the friendly voice on the end of the line had repeated<br />
                  the order I<del>ö</del>asked when they would be making their next delivery<br />
                  in the area around Kirchstetten.  "Oh but we never deliver out<br />
                  there" said the voice, "We make a special trip for the Herr<br />
                  Professor."  Startled, I exclaimed "For goodness´ sake, that must<br />
                  cost him a packet - you can buy that brand of gin in Böheimkirchen!"<br />
                  "Certainly you can" said the voice which now sounded amused,<br />
                  "but why do we have to worry our heads over the way a Herr<br />
                  Profess<del>s</del><abbr title="unclear">o</abbr>r flings his money around?"  I liked the "we".<br />
                  What was so American about the kitchen?1<br />
                  When fitted kitchens first came in the Austrians calle<del>s</del>d<abbr title="unclear">d</abbr><br />
                  them "American" - the term is now as ex<del>d</del>tinct as "Russian" tea<br />
                  but m<del>u</del>kst still have been common parlance in Kirchstetten.<br />
                  There was a tidy line-up consisting of fridge, sink, low<br />
                  cupboards providing a good working surface,,a corner <del>f</del>cupboard<br />
                  the interior of which s<del>x</del>wung out, and a gas stove.  Both men were<br />
                  very proud of the kitchen and it became Chester´s habitat.<br />
                  But the whole point of a modern kitchen:  the labour-saving<br />
                  working area, ample storage space, accessibility, was totally<br />
                  cancelled out by the permanent clutter.  It was a matter of<br />
                  principle with Chester to have all cooking ingredients con<del>c</del>veniently<br />
                  to hand, which meant that nothing was ever put away, and where<br />
                  his loving eye saw method, even the least fussy visitor could<br />
                  only see a shambles.  But an interesting shambles owing to the<br />
                  exotic nature of the preserved foods and spices which Chester<br />
                  brought with him.  There was <del>a</del> for example a dried leaf which,<br />
                  detected by me in a casserole, was said to have no flavour but<br />
                  to serve as a stimulus or bridge to other flavours.<br />
                  It was clear from the beginning that the two of them were<br />
                  not so much drinking as eating their way into their graves <del>i</del>owing

                  in which a great poet patiently explains how poetry comes to be<br />
                  written must be unique and deserves a place in the history of<br />
                  literature.

                  Declaration. 1<br />
                  Gentlemen,<br />
                  My position is very simple: one pays income tax where one<br />
                  earns money, that is to say in my case, as a writer writing in<br />
                  English, in the United States and in England.  In Austria I<br />
                  earn not one groschen, I merely spend sch<del>i</del>ullings.<br />
                  You maintain that I possess a "material interest" in Austria,<br />
                  by which you presumably mean a "financial" interest.  That might<br />
                  conceivably be the case if I had to say to myself:  "I must go<br />
                  to Austria because I can only work in Austria!"  But that is not<br />
                  the case.  I have lived in many places in many different countries<br />
                  and was always able <del>e</del>to work wherever I might be.<br />
                  I naturally have a "p<del>öe</del><abbr title="unclear">er</abbr>sonal" interest in Austria, otherwise<br />
                  I should not come here.  The landscape is pleasing, and I find<br />
                  the Austrians whose acquaintance I have made, friendly an<abbr title="unclear">sd</abbr><br />
                  charming.<br />
                  You say correctly that I once received <del>n</del>an Austrian prize<br />
                  for lieterature.  This was a great honour of which I am very<br />
                  proud.  You cannot however serioiusly believe, Gentlemen, that I<br />
                  calculated:  "If I continue to go to Austria maybe I shall be<br />
                  given a prize"?  Until it was awarded to me I had never heard<br />
                  of <del>the</del>this prize.  It is equally clear that I cannot receive it a

                  second time.  You also go on to say that a road in Kirchstetten<br />
                  has been named Audenstraße after me.  That was a very kind gesture<br />
                  on the part of the local council, but it cannot be maintaine<del>d</del>sd<br />
                  that I profit from it <del>i</del>financially.<br />
                  Further, you say with truth that I have written several poems<br />
                  <del>in A</del> <del>with</del>o<del>j</del>n Austrian themes.  To this I would like to make three<br />
                  statements.<br />
                  1.  I have never, in Austria, received so much as one<br />
                  penny for my poems.  One or two of them have been trans-<br />
                  lated into German, but in these cases the translators have<br />
                  received the money, not I.<br />
                  2.  I believe you are not clearly aware how poetry comes<br />
                  to be written.  What is generally taken to be the subject<br />
                  matter is only a viewpoint, an occasion whereby certain<br />
                  thoughts about nature, God, history, mankind etc. may be<br />
                  expressed which the poet may have had in mind for a very<br />
                  long time.  I wrote, for example, a poem to commemorate the<br />
                  20th anniversary of the death of Josef Weinheber.<br />
                  Fundamentally however the poem is concerned with quite<br />
                  different things.  First of all it is about the love<br />
                  which every poet, whatever his nationality, has for his<br />
                  mother tongue, and secondly about what happened after the<br />
                  war in the countries which were defeated, i.e. not only<br />
                  in Austria but in Germany and Italy.  Again:  in 1964<br />
                  I wrote a poem with the title "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten"<br />
                  because it was where I happ<del>p</del>ened to be.  But the place is<br />
                  unimportant.  In real<del>t</del>ity the question in this poem is<br />
                  what, for a Christian, is the meaning of the Feast of<br />
                  Pentecost.  And this is valid for all countries in the<br />
                  same way.<br />
                  3.  I believe you do not clearly recognize a poet´s (Dichte<abbr title="unclear">r</abbr>)<br />
                  financial s<del>k</del>ituation.  If he is suc<del>e</del><abbr title="unclear">c</abbr>essful, a novelist<br />
                  can ma<del>,</del>ke a good deal of money.  A poet (Lyriker) cannot,<br />
                  even if he is very well known, because he is only read<br />
                  by a minority.  By far the greater part of my income<br />
                  comes not from the sale of my volumes of poetry but from<br />
                  book reviews, translations, lectures etc., activities<br />
                  which have nothing to do with Austria.  A<del>m</del><abbr title="unclear">n</abbr>d while we are

                  on the subject of translation<del>:</del>s  you rightly say that<br />
                  I have a great int<del>r</del>erest in German and Austrian literatu<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  I may add in music as well - but I do not have to come<br />
                  to Austria in order to read or to hear them.<br />
                  You see f<del>ero</del><abbr title="unclear">rom</abbr> all <del>the above</del> this that the arguments brought<br />
                  forward by you for subjecting me to payment of income tax are not<br />
                  valid.  The most pertinent argument against it is that in the<br />
                  course of one year I always stay under six months in Austri<del>sa</del><abbr title="unclear">aa</abbr><br />
                  and never spend more than three months here consecutively.<br />
                  A word in conclusion: if this in my view entirely unjustifiable<br />
                  nonsense does not cease, I shall leave Austria never to return,<br />
                  which would be very sad for me and perhaps too for the shopkeepers<br />
                  <del>i</del>of Kirchstetten.  One thing, Gentlemen, I cannot conceal from you:<br />
                  if this should happen it m<del>i</del>kght give rise to a scandal of worldwide<br />
                  dimensions.<br />
                  W.H. Auden.
               </p><p>   
                  1 You ask why I have made over my half of our property in<br />
                  Kirchstetten to Mr Chester Kallman who is not related to me.<br />
                  Mr Kallman is my heir.  I have no children and for years past<br />
                  he has been my literary collaborator.  <del>s</del>Jointly, we have written<br />
                  five new opera libretti, "The Rake´s Progress, "Elegy for Young<br />
                  Lovers", "The Bassarids_" and "Love´s Labours Lost".  And<br />
                  together we have made new translations of "The MagiccFlute",<br />
                  "Don Giovanni", "Die Sieben Todsünden", "Mahagonny" and<br />
                  "Archifanfaro".  I am now 65 years old and must reckon with all<br />
                  eventualities such as a heart attack.  As you know better than<br />
                  I, in the event of sudden death great difficulties arise for the<br />
                  heirs to landed property, particularly in a foreign country.

                  "Every day f<del>p</del>or the past year" said Chester "I have stood<br />
                  outside his door in the early morning, afraid to go in."<br />
                  This was later.  Now, Auden was dead, the voice issuing<br />
                  from the car radio had just said so.  A few days ago we had<br />
                  talked about his reading in the Society for Literature on 28<br />
                  September.  Unfortunately, I said, I was obliged to drive to<br />
                  Linz and to spend the n<del>i</del>kght there, but they were welcome to use<br />
                  my Vienna flat.  It was maddening and I would just as soon<br />
                  put it off.  No, said Auden, mustn´t do that, one should stick<br />
                  to one´s commitments.  "And you won´t be missing much" he<br />
                  reassured me, "you´ve heard it all before."  We would meet again<br />
                  in a few days´time and then he would tell me all about it.  He was<br />
                  not sure about the fla<del>as</del>t but he would let me know in good time.<br />
                  On 24 September he wrote a note to say that he did not need the<br />
                  flat, he would go to the Hotel Altenburgerhof.  The handwriting<br />
                  is ragged.<br />
                  Linz already lay far behind, the car radio went on m<del>k</del>uttering<br />
                  to itself unheeded until the familiar voice of Friedrich Hee<del>ee</del>r<del></del>r<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  came through, reading one of his book reviews.  It was consoling<br />
                  in a world where, suddenly, a signpost was missing.  W<del>j</del>hat are<br />
                  you howling about, I asked myself, what gives you the right to<br />
                  mourn for Wystan?  Think of Chester.  It was impossible not to<br />
                  think of Chester:  it was not so much a question how much he<br />
                  would grieve over the death of Wystan, as how he would survive<br />
                  at all.  Leaving the autobahn at St.Pölten I drove straight to<br />
                  Kirchstetten;  it seemed to be just possible that he might have<br />
                  arrived in the meantime.  But the green shutters were closed<br />
                  and there was no one about apart from the wall-eyed dog, an<br />
                  exceptionally hideous mongrel belonging to Frau Strobl, which<br />
                  barked in an irritating falsetto.  He barked from a position close<br />
                  beside me while I wrote a note and stuck it in the chink between<br />
                  the door´s shutters, and he was still barking as I shut the<br />
                  garden gate behind me.<br />
                  The answer to my note was a telephone call from Frau Strobl:<br />
                  Herr Kallman said, would I come over to tea the next day?<br />
                  That was the Sunday.

                  The sittingroom seemed to be full of people.  <del>-</del>Chester was<br />
                  sitting on the corner-seat facing the door, where Auden always<br />
                  used to sit, every <del>seat</del>chair appeared to be occupied and two young<br />
                  men were sitting <del>in the back</del> on the floor.  Chester hurried<br />
                  across the room, hugged me and said "The whole thing´s terrible,<br />
                  you have to help me."<br />
                  I was introduced to the others.  Mrs. Thekla Clark and her<br />
                  daughter had come up from Florence as soon<del>a</del>as t<del>e</del>hey heard the<br />

                  of Kirchstetten, <del>a</del>the film scriptwriter Adolf Opel, and the young men.<br />
                  Clearly, the meeting to discuss the funeral arra<del>n</del>ggements was<br />
                  not proceeding smoothly.  The mayor looked annoyed, Frau Seitz<br />
                  looked worried and Mrs Clark bewildered.  There were, of course,<br />
                  language difficulties.  Mayor Enzinger spoke not a word of<br />
                  <del>G</del>English and the Clarks no German, while the headmistress had a<br />
                  certain command of English but did not feel up to acting as<br />
                  interpreter and adviser in one;  Chester´a German was perfect<del>k</del><abbr title="unclear">l</abbr>y<br />
                  adequate.<br />
                  The root of the problem lay on a deeper level, where two<br />
                  separate cultures collided head on.  Chester was barely coherent,<br />
                  but he managed to explain his point of view.  He loathed, from<br />
                  the bottom of his hearteverything in the way of pompes funèbres.<br />
                  He wanted to bury Aud<del>s</del><abbr title="unclear">e</abbr>n, he said, quietly and privately and, if<br />
                  it could possibly be managed, on Tuesday.  He had already informed<br />
                  Wyst<del>s</del>an´s brother Dr. John Auden, Stephen Spender and <del>os</del>others<br />
                  of the arran<del>t</del>gements and asked them to arrive, if not tomorrow,<br />
                  then on Tuesday morning at the latest.  On the other hand the<br />
                  mayor of Kirchstetten, he went on, wanted to lay on a really big<br />
                  show with brass bands and all the rest of it, and what was more<br />
                  on the Saturday to give as many people as possible the chance to<br />
                  come.  The Ministry of Education and the provincial council of<br />
                  Lower Austria were to be represented, and as the last straw the<br />
                  hearse was to drive <del>i</del>up to the house.  He would not allow any of<br />
                  this, he said:  "I can´t bear it and I won´t have it."<br />
                  Mayor Enzinger drew a deep breath.  The first thing we had<br />
                  to realise, he pointed out, was that the body had not yet been

                  released by the authorities.  In all cases where the cause of death<br />
                  is not wholly clear certain<abbr title="unclear">k</abbr>formalities are obligatory, and even<br />
                  intervention at a high level would not work miracles.  Everything<br />
                  takes time.  And how could anyone expect it of him, the Bürgermeister<abbr title="unclear">,</abbr><br />
                  that he should refrain from notifying the Ministry and the Cultural<br />
                  department of the Council of the <del>d</del>eeath of Professor _Auden?  It<br />
                  was as much as his job was wor<abbr title="unclear">t</abbr>h.  Now Frau Seitz spoke.  The<br />
                  inhabitants of Kirchstetten, she believed, would hardly bury a dog<br />
                  in the manner proposed by Herr Kallman, let alone a great poet.<br />
                  Chester Kallman´s position was entirely comprehensible - to<br />
                  some of us.  To him, an <del>E</del>American of Jewish origin and a non-believer,<br />
                  the whole pomp and circumstance of a traditional Austrian funeral<br />
                  was abhorrent.  Where prominent personages are concerned, there<br />
                  would certainly be the local brass band, and where appropr<abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>a<abbr title="unclear">te</abbr> delegations representing<br />
                  the voluntary fire brigade, the federal railways, the veterans´<br />
                  association and others besides, and the gamekeepers would blow<br />
                  their horns and wish him good hunting in the Elysian fields.<br />
                  To Chester´s mind such folksy rituals were as foreign as the burial<br />
                  rites of the Incas.  He did not know that not very long ago in<br />
                  Lower Austria, Auden as a bachelor would have been accompanied in<br />
                  the funeral procession by a "bride" dressed in white.  He was<br />
                  unable to understand that his intentions were an intolerable affront<br />
                  to the population of Kirchstetten.  In his despair, it certainly<br />
                  never occurred to him that Auden himself would very likely have<br />
                  been entranced at the idea of a slap-up funeral with all the<br />
                  trimmings - one can almost hear his Olympian laughter - followed<br />
                  by a hearty meal at the inn where he had so often <del>had</del>ate his l<del>i</del>unch.<br />
                  As it turned out, Chester got no marks in local opinion for this<br />
                  finale either, as the meal consisted of Leberkäs with vegetables:<br />
                  <abbr title="unclear">T</abbr>his consisted of fried slices off a loaf of a flabby substance which is neither liver nor cheese related to the<br />
                  Frankfurter sausage.  It is a<br />
                  homely, juicy meal all too familiar to every Austrian;  a<del>b</del>nd it is<br />
                  cheap.<del>n</del> There would be <del>mkuc</del> much talk of this also after all was ove<abbr title="unclear">r</abbr><br />
                  For their part, the local people were forgetting that Chester was<br />
                  probably in financial straits - not that this would have been taken<br />
                  as an excuse.<br />
                  For a moment the discussion had come to a standstill.<br />

                  fetched more beer, Frau Strobl walked in and out and rolled a<br />
                  baleful eye on us as she spoke into Chester´s ear.<br />
                  The points at issue were not only When and How Much;  there<br />
                  was also the matter of the church service and the prayers at the<br />
                  graveside.  Many people in Akustria had assumed Auden to be of the<br />
                  Roman Catholic faith;  he had of course remained <del>-</del>a:<del>s</del>member of the<br />
                  Anglican and Episcopalian churche<del>e</del>s.  The misunderstanding arose<br />
                  from his regular attendance at mass in the parish church and his<br />
                  friendly relationship with Father Lustkandl, the parish priest<br />
                  referred to in "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten".  Auden asked<br />
                  Lustkandl´s sucessor for permission to be buried in the churchyard,<br />
                  and his wish was accede<del>o</del><abbr title="unclear">d</abbr> to.   Evid<del>n</del>ently<abbr title="unclear">,</abbr> <del>T</del>the next <abbr title="unclear">l</abbr>ogical thing to do, then,<br />
                  was to approach the chaplain to the British Embassy in Vienna,´<br />
                  the Revd. Bruce Duncan, and ask him to officiate.  What form of<br />
                  service this should be - there could be no question of a funeral<br />
                  mass - left everyone present at a loss.  We agreed at last that<br />
                  it ought to be some kind of ecumenical ceremony held jointly by<br />
                  the two clergymen, but that first of all, the plan must be put<br />
                  before D<del>D</del>r John Auden.<br />
                  At this juncture Chester Kallman withdrew his insistence on<br />
                  <del>an all too early funeral.</del>  the impossibly early date for the<br />
                  funeral.  The room had become much too warm, the oxygen was<br />
                  running out and Chester would not be able to stand much more<br />
                  pressure.  The most urgent <del>step</del> objective waslquite simply to<br />
                  free him from our burdensome presence.  Once everyone had agreed<br />
                  that Auden´s relations must be told immediately that the funeral<br />
                  <del>ah</del>had been postponed, the moment had come to dissolve the meeting.<br />
                  Mrs Clark undertook to telephone to London and Frau Strobl would<br />
                  drive her to the Post Office.  Chester asked me to talk everything<br />
                  over with Frau Seitz and Herr Enzinger and reach definite concl<del>i</del>u-<br />
                  sions.  We all stood up, Chester came across the room to me and<br />
                  spoke in an undertone.  He was completely exhausted, he said,<br />
                  he couldn´t stand much more.  "I´ll do anything you want, you<br />
                  must just try to hold the others in check." Finally he said<br />
                  "It´ll be all right, I´m crammed full of tranquillizers, all I<br />
                  need is a bit of a rest."  He embraced me warmly and left the room.

                  thr procession halted while the coffin was transferred from the<br />
                  hearse to a hand-drawn bier.  At this point the Church took charge<br />
                  and the procession resumed its steady pace;  photographs exist<br />
                  which were taken during the brief interval.<br />
                  To British ears quite unremarkable, the ecumenic<del>la</del>al service<br />
                  was much ta<del>o</del>Iked about in A<del>ku</del>ustrian circles because nothing of the<br />
                  kind had been known <del>n</del>before.  The Revd. Bruce Du<del>o</del>ncan, today Rector<br />
                  of Crediton in Devon, can remember little <del>more</del> about the general<br />
                  circumstances but confirms that he used the Book of Common Prayer<br />
                  and the long reading from the first <del>book</del>Letter of St.Paul to the<br />
                  Corin<del>g</del>thians, chapter 15, verses 20-58. Beyond that, all he recalls<br />
                  <del>is the hysterical behaviour </del> is his difficulties with Chester.<br />
                  Reaching for my Authorised Version, for surely no one would<br />
                  have dared to use any other, on second thoughts I also took out the<br />
                  New Testament as translated into German by Martin Luther.  After<br />
                  reading the English text through ve<del>d</del>ry slowly, and then a second<br />
                  time, I did the same with the Luther<del>n</del>an Bible and lost in thought<br />
                  compared the two, verse by verse.<br />
                  "How nice to see you" said Auden who was sitting on one of the<br />
                  white garden chairs with the red covers, "it´s a bit einsam here.<br />
                  And I wanted to write and tell you that the technical word for<br />
                  buddle is Erzwaschtrog.  I hope there is an equivalent German<br />
                  euphemism for `senior citizen´.  Oh and adit is stollen, and although<br />
                  I may be wrong, I guess concentrating mill is Vereinigungsmühle."<br />
                  "What a mercy you´ve told me" I said, relieved.  "I should have<br />
                  to have dug up such frightful words in the British Council library.<br />
                  But do you think people will understand all that about the primary<br />
                  and secondary worlds, or will they get muddled?"<br />
                  "It´s perfectly simple" said Auden.  "The initial impulse to<br />
                  create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by encounters,<br />
                  in the primary world, with sacred beings or events."<br />
                  "There is one glory of the sun" I heard myself say, "and<br />
                  another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars:  for on

                  "Ah" he said, "you´ve been reading Corinthians One, chapter 15.<br />
                  `Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.´ Chester and I took<br />
                  that bidding rather too literally."<br />
                  "Who would know where that familiar quotation comes from?"<br />
                  I wondered.<br />
                  "I would" said Auden.  "I´ve been looking up the German text.<br />
                  Have you ever compared the Autho<del>s</del>rized Version with Martin Luther?"<br />
                  "Funny you should ask that" I said.  "It´s one of the things<br />
                  I forgot to talk to you about.  `Be not deceived:  evil<del>,</del>comm<del>ku</del>unica-<br />
                  tions corrupt good manners.´ He renders that as <abbr title="unclear">`L</abbr>asset euch nicht<br />
                  verführen!  Böse Geschwätze verderben gute Sitten.´"<br />
                  "Very neat" said Auden happily.  I like `evil chatter´<br />
                  better than `comm<del>k</del>unications´."<br />
                  "The publishers" Isaid "have a rather heavy-handed way of<br />
                  printing the more quotable bits in bold-face.  But in the next<br />
                  verse Luther seems to flounder.  `Werdet doch einmal recht nüchtern<br />
                  und sündiget nicht!<abbr title="unclear">´"</abbr> Do be a bit sober for once, he pleads.  And<br />
                  sin not.  King James´s translators fancied that St Paul cried out<br />
                  <del>Ss</del>`Awake to righteousness!"<br />
                  "Who knows what he really said."<br />
                  "Luther´s language is very fine as he reaches the clim<del>x</del>ax:<br />
                  `Siehe, ich sage euch ein Geheimnis... ´"<br />
                  But Auden was speaking.  "Behold, I shew you a mystery:<br />
                  we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment,<br />
                  in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:  for the trumpet<br />
                  shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we<br />
                  shall be changed.´"  And with that he vanished.  Now wide awake, I<br />
                  put the two books back on their shelf and settled down to re-type<br />
                  Auden´s speech at Neulengbach.<br />
                  Sehr verehrter Herr Landeshauptmann, Ladies and gentlemen:<br />

                  In Retrospect.
                  Since then the Auden industry has not been idle.  An
                  excellent biography was published1 and <del>i</del>kn this the Austrian
                  period was dealt with but not locally researched.  Edward
                  Mendelson edited Auden´s early works and wrote superb commentaries.
                  There has been a biography of Chester Kallman.  Writers of PhD
                  theses have been out here and have shaken us up, particularly
                  Michael O´Sullivan of Trinity College, Dublin who - not speaking
                  a word of German - organised a full-scale exhibition and an
                  international symposium in Vienna.  The editor of this volume
                  Peter Müller had brought Michael out to see me at Fri<del>d</del>eau in the
                  preceding year;  now he came again, and after the closure,
                  exhausted, he spent a long weekend in the country to recover.
                  We dug out ancient files containing original Auden manuscripts,
                  letters, personal notes and newspaper cuttings, and now we tried
                  to winnow the wheat from the chaff.  After some general discussion
                  it seemed to us all that there remain certain aspects of Auden´s
                  life in Lower Austria which are not on record, or where they are,
                  not from the worm´s eye view.  As an older man he was happier
                  here than anywhere else:  he felt at home.  He was at Kirchstette
                  not only during the summer, <del>i</del>as is often said, but with
                  interruptions for five months, depending on his engagements.
                  In the course of these years he was still highly <del>productive</del>
                  creative.  So that it might, we thought, be of value to put some
                  of those things on record which would otherwise be lost.  Not
                  for the first time self<del>.</del>-criticism was expressed, but while doubts
                  concerning self-importance<del>as</del>and sell-out of f<del>i</del>riendship were not
                  entirely banished, the view prevailed that the local witness
                  needs to be put on paper.  Scholarship is at work elsewhere;
                  here a few appendices and footnotes are on offer.
                  Auden´s opinions on biographies of creative artists in general
                  were, as Humphrey Carpenter pointed out, highly contradictory.
                  Again and again he said that the private life of poets and other
                  people engaged in creative work is none of the public´s business
                  but he also said:´`The biography of an artist, if his life as a whole
                  was sufficiently interesting, is permissible, provided that the
                  biographer and his readers realise that such an account throws no
                  light whatsoever upon the artist´s work."  And "I do believe,
                  however, that, more often than most people realise, <del>k</del>his works
                  may throw light upon his life."

                  Carpenter´s book calls itself "a first biography", and the
                  author expressly restricts his aims:  "It is not a work of literary
                  criticism".  It may also be felt to lack an analysis of some
                  fundamental questions:  about the depths of the poet´s personality,
                  his "otherness" (to confine this to his homosexuality would be to
                  oversimplify) and the basis of his all-important relationship
                  with Chester Kallman.  As a star<del>it</del>ting point, "Early Auden"1 which
                  presents an<del>s</del>d comments on the poetry, drama and prose up to 1939
                  is most valuable, and Edward Mendelson will produce further works
                  of scholarship.
                  What would Wystan Auden say if he could read "Auden in Love"
                  by Chester´s old coll<del>a</del>ege friend and last-minute stepmother Dorothy
                  J. Farnon?2  In July 1985 the Sunday Times published a list of
                  recommended holiday <del>books</del> reading.  The assessment of "Auden in
                  Love" was a model of compression:  "emetic but compulsive".
                  I more than once came up against Auden´s idée fixe about the
                  irrelevance of the poet´s private self, and asked him one day:
                  "So no rotting apples in the desk drawer?"  "No, no rotting apples
                  "And if you have an attack of the trots and interrupt your work?"
                  "That would make no difference at all."  Chester´s sole explanatio
                  was that it was "a tick like any other", and that in any case he
                  was totally inconsistent.  Be that as it may, if the effect on the
                  general public was judged as emetic, Auden´s nausea can be
                  imagined.  All the same, it is a fascinating book, and for people
                  who knew the two men only in <del>r</del>the later years of their lives, does thro
                  light on apparently conflicting phenomena and makes their actions,
                  and Chester´s character in particular, more comprehensible.
                  When Auden first met Kallman he was just 32 and already a poet
                  with an established reputation, respected and even revered on
                  many a campus.  Kallman was an 18 year old undergraduate,
                  brilliant, beautiful, focal<del>l</del>point and leader of a crowd of young
                  intellectuals of both sexes.  He was a Dorian Grey figure,
                  sparkling<del>a</del>and damned, hero and victim, immature and over-ripe,
                  sensitive and heartless, a man capable of loving and of being

                  loved but who was already - though Auden did not know it -
                  add<del>di</del>icted to promiscuity.  In literature and music his knowledge
                  was, for his age, above average, but when important examinations
                  loomed a kind of petulant mood would come over him and he would
                  fail to appear.
                  Chester never wanted to earn his living, and all his life he wa
                  supported financially by other people, particularly by Auden.
                  He usually promptly lost what he was given because he was
                  perpetually being robbed by se<del>ö</del>amen picked up on the wharfs of
                  New York.  By one of them he was robbed of three months´ income
                  in succession.  Or else he gave it away:  no matter what actually
                  happened, the money left his pocket.
                  The scene shifts to a flat in the Esslingasse in Vienna´s
                  3rd District, where Kallman once spent the winter.  He gave a
                  party one evening, and afterwards I took two or three of the men
                  part of t<del>i</del>heir way home in my car.  When Chester told me later on
                  that the m<del>s</del>an who, as it chanced, had been sitting beside me, had
                  gone off with 2,000 schillings taken out of the pocket of a
                  jacket hanging on the bedroom door, I could not know that this
                  was not a mere incident but almost a matter of routine.  When,
                  ultimately, he took with him to Athens 80,000 sch. in cash
                  (proceeds of the sale of a building plot) and lost it all on the
                  way, this mishap was almost a foregone conclusion.
                  That the sexual relationship between Auden and Kallman
                  ceased as far back as 19<del>5</del>41 is well known:  from that time on -
                  there is evidence in the poetry - sex and love became, for Auden,
                  t<del>o</del>wo separate matters.  He felt married to Chester (when he was
                  not Mother) for the rest of his life, and he wrote that Chester
                  was the only person who, emotionally and intellectually, was
                  wholly indispensable to him.
                  Like it or not, this statement has to be accepted with all
                  the weight it carries.  It was never possible, even in the
                  Austrian era, to keep Chester in purdah for long, and when there
                  was a visitor from Athens at Hinterholz 6 there could be tensio<del></del>n.
                  Auden gave orders to Yannis Boras in the abrupt tones of a
                  colonial Englishman of yore speaking to the "boy", and when I
                  asked one day at lu<del>c</del>nch: "Where is, er....?" he said with a

                  smirk of satisfaction: "I sent him up on to the roof to mend tiles."
                  But fundamentally nothing had changed between them:  this explains
                  <del>his</del>Auden´s intense anxiety over the death of Boras in a car accident in
                  Lower Austria, and his fear communicated itself to me as I searched
                  for Chester in Vienna.  It was nearly Christmas, what on earth
                  would become of him, distraught and alone?  (He had in fact not
                  go<del>en</del>ne to Austria after all, but had not let Auden know.) There
                  followed the gloomy summer <del>l</del>of 1969 when Chester was sunk in deep
                  depression while Wyśtan had a full work programme, and when he
                  told me he could hardly think how Chester would get through the
                  summer1this was indeed Mother speaking.
                  What was it in Chester Kallman that made him so entirely
                  indispensable to Auden?  Perhaps the question is impossible to
                  answer;  some may hold it to be inadmissible, or attempts to find
                  points of reference impertinent.  Others again may find the whole
                  subject unappetising.  But to anyone with an interest in psychology
                  in the processes of cre<del>w</del>ativity in general and in those of Auden
                  in particular, there is no way of getting round this essential
                  relationship.  It may, after all, come to be seen as one of the
                  most curious in the history of English literature.
                  In their love of music, of opera above all, Kallma<del>n</del>nwas in
                  the lead.  He was a minor poet who wrote because he needed to do s
                  but his output was slight.  Yet in many spheres which were of
                  intense interest to Auden he had little, sometimes nothing to offer:
                  German literature (though Chester picked <del>i</del>up languages with uncommon
                  facility; Wystan´s <del>G</del> spoken German was execrable but his compre-
                  hension unerring), the history of cultures, religion and liturgy,
                  translation.  When I was with them Wystan did not only most of the
                  talking, but of the asking as well; his great charm lay in his
                  alert interest in other people´s work, and he would draw one out
                  on the odder backwaters of Austrian history.  This side of him comes
                  out in a letter dated 6 July 1970.  When the historian Friedrich
                  Heer and <del>A</del>Yuden, both entranced, struck sparks off one another all
                  afternoon, Kallman was silent.  Kallman lacked Auden´s sensitivity
                  to places and people, <del>ot</del> to the genius loci;  perhaps it was just
                  that he was an American, and a New Yorker, while Auden never

                  lost his roots in Europe.
                  On his own ground, operatic libretti, Chester Kallman was
                  still in good running order, and when the Rake´s Progress was put
                  on in Vienna he wrote a letter to Die Presse protesting sharply
                  <del>over</del>against the cuts <del>which had been</del> made by the producer.  But of that
                  conversational brilliance which old friends have described there
                  was little sign.  A scene comes to mind: Auden was away, and Chester
                  asked me to meet him for lunch at a restaurant off the Kärntner-
                  strasse.  A young man whose background clearly lay somewhere
                  within the crime belt near the Prater was with him, and soon the
                  youth <del></del>sand I were engrossed in conversation, while Chester, feeling
                  out of it, sulked.  Immediately after coffee it seemed best to
                  leave them.  Chester´s intelligence and wit had not deserted him
                  but they had too little scope, and, perhaps owing to his carp-like
                  appearance, he was liable to be underestimated.  He was good-natured,
                  in course of time even affectionate, hospitable and amusing.  He
                  looked after Auden devotedly and we know that he was able to banish
                  Auden´s loneliness as no one else could.  His misfortune was that
                  he lacked those qualities which Auden possessed and which decide
                  between success and failure.
                  It cannot, all the same, have been easy living on a long-term
                  basis with Auden in New Yo<del>r</del>wk while attempting, even though
                  fitfully, to develop his own personality and talents.  Putting up with Auden´s
                  fads, his insistence on punctuality and the rigid routine was one
                  thing;  to grow up, to mature in the shadow of this oversized tree
                  was another.  There was not enough light.  So he fled, but without
                  Mother there was no way he could live at all.
                  It is essentia<del>sl</del>l, in the light of what happened later on, to
                  remember Auden´s generosity.  His biographer mentioned the two boys
                  whose further education was financed by Auden:  I can confirm this
                  as we lived next door to them for a few years.  They were the sons of
                  an artist;  both made rapid careers in industrial management.  But
                  there were other examples.  Wyst<del>s</del>an had telephoned and asked me to
                  meet him and Chester at the Operncafé - the much-missed café-
                  restaurant next to the Opera, now a car salesroom.  They were waiting
                  for Balanchine to join them after the performance, but we waited in
                  vain and fi<del>kn</del>nally gave up and went home.  There was a fourth at our
                  table, a silent young man who, Chester said in an undertone, was
                  a student of technology and Wyst<del>sa</del>an was helping with his studies.

                  Dear Stella, Got back from Oxford yesterday and found your

                  If they are, all rooms, including my study (which can´t be
                  heated) are open to them.  2)  How m<del>ku</del>uch money will they need
                  to keep going?  And how shall I make the arrangements for
                  payment.  3) Will they be able to find work or emigrate
                  before I return in April, when I´m afraid there will not
                  be room for them?  4) I´m worried about how they will get
                  gas cylinders for cooking from Neulengbach, since, presumably,
                  they have no car.  I expect someone in the village will help.

                  but he was running out of gin.   If I´d be an angel and ring
                  up Wild on the Neuer Markt and ask them to send a few bottles out -
                  he told me the brand name - that would be splendid.
                  When the friendly voice on the end of the line had repeated
                  the order I<del>ö</del>asked when they would be making their next delivery
                  in the area around Kirchstetten.  "Oh but we never deliver out

                  cost him a packet - you can buy that brand of gin in Böheimkirchen!"
                  "Certainly you can" said the voice which now sounded amused,

                  What was so American about the kitchen?1
                  When fitted kitchens first came in the Austrians calle<del>s</del>dd
                  them "American" - the term is now as ex<del>d</del>tinct as "Russian" tea
                  but m<del>u</del>kst still have been common parlance in Kirchstetten.
                  There was a tidy line-up consisting of fridge, sink, low
                  cupboards providing a good working surface,,a corner <del>f</del>cupboard
                  the interior of which s<del>x</del>wung out, and a gas stove.  Both men were
                  very proud of the kitchen and it became Chester´s habitat.
                  But the whole point of a modern kitchen:  the labour-saving
                  working area, ample storage space, accessibility, was totally
                  cancelled out by the permanent clutter.  It was a matter of
                  principle with Chester to have all cooking ingredients con<del>c</del>veniently
                  to hand, which meant that nothing was ever put away, and where
                  his loving eye saw method, even the least fussy visitor could
                  only see a shambles.  But an interesting shambles owing to the
                  exotic nature of the preserved foods and spices which Chester
                  brought with him.  There was <del>a</del> for example a dried leaf which,
                  detected by me in a casserole, was said to have no flavour but
                  to serve as a stimulus or bridge to other flavours.

                  Whether or not - and Chester was convinced that this was so -

                  in which a great poet patiently explains how poetry comes to be

                  Declaration. 1
                  Gentlemen,
                  My position is very simple: one pays income tax where one
                  earns money, that is to say in my case, as a writer writing in
                  English, in the United States and in England.  In Austria I
                  earn not one groschen, I merely spend sch<del>i</del>ullings.
                  You maintain that I possess a "material interest" in Austria,
                  by which you presumably mean a "financial" interest.  That might
                  conceivably be the case if I had to say to myself:  "I must go
                  to Austria because I can only work in Austria!"  But that is not
                  the case.  I have lived in many places in many different countries
                  and was always able <del>e</del>to work wherever I might be.
                  I naturally have a "p<del>öe</del>ersonal" interest in Austria, otherwise
                  I should not come here.  The landscape is pleasing, and I find
                  the Austrians whose acquaintance I have made, friendly ansd
                  charming.
                  You say correctly that I once received <del>n</del>an Austrian prize
                  for lieterature.  This was a great honour of which I am very
                  proud.  You cannot however serioiusly believe, Gentlemen, that I
                  calculated:  "If I continue to go to Austria maybe I shall be
                  given a prize"?  Until it was awarded to me I had never heard
                  of <del>the</del>this prize.  It is equally clear that I cannot receive it a

                  second time.  You also go on to say that a road in Kirchstetten
                  has been named Audenstraße after me.  That was a very kind gesture
                  on the part of the local council, but it cannot be maintaine<del>d</del>sd
                  that I profit from it <del>i</del>financially.
                  Further, you say with truth that I have written several poems
                  <del>in A</del> <del>with</del>o<del>j</del>n Austrian themes.  To this I would like to make three
                  statements.
                  1.  I have never, in Austria, received so much as one
                  penny for my poems.  One or two of them have been trans-
                  lated into German, but in these cases the translators have
                  received the money, not I.
                  2.  I believe you are not clearly aware how poetry comes
                  to be written.  What is generally taken to be the subject
                  matter is only a viewpoint, an occasion whereby certain
                  thoughts about nature, God, history, mankind etc. may be
                  expressed which the poet may have had in mind for a very
                  long time.  I wrote, for example, a poem to commemorate the
                  20th anniversary of the death of Josef Weinheber.
                  Fundamentally however the poem is concerned with quite
                  different things.  First of all it is about the love
                  which every poet, whatever his nationality, has for his
                  mother tongue, and secondly about what happened after the
                  war in the countries which were defeated, i.e. not only
                  in Austria but in Germany and Italy.  Again:  in 1964
                  I wrote a poem with the title "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten"
                  because it was where I happ<del>p</del>ened to be.  But the place is
                  unimportant.  In real<del>t</del>ity the question in this poem is
                  what, for a Christian, is the meaning of the Feast of
                  Pentecost.  And this is valid for all countries in the
                  same way.
                  3.  I believe you do not clearly recognize a poet´s (Dichter)
                  financial s<del>k</del>ituation.  If he is suc<del>e</del>cessful, a novelist
                  can ma<del>,</del>ke a good deal of money.  A poet (Lyriker) cannot,
                  even if he is very well known, because he is only read
                  by a minority.  By far the greater part of my income
                  comes not from the sale of my volumes of poetry but from
                  book reviews, translations, lectures etc., activities
                  which have nothing to do with Austria.  A<del>m</del>nd while we are

                  on the subject of translation<del>:</del>s  you rightly say that

                  I may add in music as well - but I do not have to come
                  to Austria in order to read or to hear them.
                  You see f<del>ero</del>rom all <del>the above</del> this that the arguments brought
                  forward by you for subjecting me to payment of income tax are not
                  valid.  The most pertinent argument against it is that in the
                  course of one year I always stay under six months in Austri<del>sa</del>aa
                  and never spend more than three months here consecutively.
                  A word in conclusion: if this in my view entirely unjustifiable
                  nonsense does not cease, I shall leave Austria never to return,
                  which would be very sad for me and perhaps too for the shopkeepers

                  Kirchstetten to Mr Chester Kallman who is not related to me.
                  Mr Kallman is my heir.  I have no children and for years past
                  he has been my literary collaborator.  <del>s</del>Jointly, we have written
                  five new opera libretti, "The Rake´s Progress, "Elegy for Young
                  Lovers", "The Bassarids_" and "Love´s Labours Lost".  And
                  together we have made new translations of "The MagiccFlute",
                  "Don Giovanni", "Die Sieben Todsünden", "Mahagonny" and
                  "Archifanfaro".  I am now 65 years old and must reckon with all
                  eventualities such as a heart attack.  As you know better than
                  I, in the event of sudden death great difficulties arise for the
                  heirs to landed property, particularly in a foreign country.

                  "Every day f<del>p</del>or the past year" said Chester "I have stood
                  outside his door in the early morning, afraid to go in."
                  This was later.  Now, Auden was dead, the voice issuing
                  from the car radio had just said so.  A few days ago we had
                  talked about his reading in the Society for Literature on 28
                  September.  Unfortunately, I said, I was obliged to drive to
                  Linz and to spend the n<del>i</del>kght there, but they were welcome to use
                  my Vienna flat.  It was maddening and I would just as soon
                  put it off.  No, said Auden, mustn´t do that, one should stick
                  to one´s commitments.  "And you won´t be missing much" he
                  reassured me, "you´ve heard it all before."  We would meet again
                  in a few days´time and then he would tell me all about it.  He was
                  not sure about the fla<del>as</del>t but he would let me know in good time.
                  On 24 September he wrote a note to say that he did not need the
                  flat, he would go to the Hotel Altenburgerhof.  The handwriting
                  is ragged.
                  Linz already lay far behind, the car radio went on m<del>k</del>uttering
                  to itself unheeded until the familiar voice of Friedrich Hee<del>ee</del>r<del></del>r
                  came through, reading one of his book reviews.  It was consoling
                  in a world where, suddenly, a signpost was missing.  W<del>j</del>hat are
                  you howling about, I asked myself, what gives you the right to
                  mourn for Wystan?  Think of Chester.  It was impossible not to
                  think of Chester:  it was not so much a question how much he
                  would grieve over the death of Wystan, as how he would survive
                  at all.  Leaving the autobahn at St.Pölten I drove straight to
                  Kirchstetten;  it seemed to be just possible that he might have
                  arrived in the meantime.  But the green shutters were closed
                  and there was no one about apart from the wall-eyed dog, an
                  exceptionally hideous mongrel belonging to Frau Strobl, which
                  barked in an irritating falsetto.  He barked from a position close
                  beside me while I wrote a note and stuck it in the chink between
                  the door´s shutters, and he was still barking as I shut the
                  garden gate behind me.
                  The answer to my note was a telephone call from Frau Strobl:
                  Herr Kallman said, would I come over to tea the next day?
                  That was the Sunday.

                  The sittingroom seemed to be full of people.  <del>-</del>Chester was
                  sitting on the corner-seat facing the door, where Auden always
                  used to sit, every <del>seat</del>chair appeared to be occupied and two young
                  men were sitting <del>in the back</del> on the floor.  Chester hurried
                  across the room, hugged me and said "The whole thing´s terrible,
                  you have to help me."
                  I was introduced to the others.  Mrs. Thekla Clark and her
                  daughter had come up from Florence as soon<del>a</del>as t<del>e</del>hey heard the
                  news;  there was Frau Maria Seitz, headmistress of the high school;
                  <del>in Kirchstetten, the mayor Herr Enzinger</del> Herr Enzinger the mayor
                  of Kirchstetten, <del>a</del>the film scriptwriter Adolf Opel, and the young men.
                  Clearly, the meeting to discuss the funeral arra<del>n</del>ggements was
                  not proceeding smoothly.  The mayor looked annoyed, Frau Seitz
                  looked worried and Mrs Clark bewildered.  There were, of course,
                  language difficulties.  Mayor Enzinger spoke not a word of
                  <del>G</del>English and the Clarks no German, while the headmistress had a
                  certain command of English but did not feel up to acting as
                  interpreter and adviser in one;  Chester´a German was perfect<del>k</del>ly
                  adequate.
                  The root of the problem lay on a deeper level, where two
                  separate cultures collided head on.  Chester was barely coherent,
                  but he managed to explain his point of view.  He loathed, from
                  the bottom of his hearteverything in the way of pompes funèbres.
                  He wanted to bury Aud<del>s</del>en, he said, quietly and privately and, if
                  it could possibly be managed, on Tuesday.  He had already informed
                  Wyst<del>s</del>an´s brother Dr. John Auden, Stephen Spender and <del>os</del>others
                  of the arran<del>t</del>gements and asked them to arrive, if not tomorrow,
                  then on Tuesday morning at the latest.  On the other hand the
                  mayor of Kirchstetten, he went on, wanted to lay on a really big
                  show with brass bands and all the rest of it, and what was more
                  on the Saturday to give as many people as possible the chance to
                  come.  The Ministry of Education and the provincial council of
                  Lower Austria were to be represented, and as the last straw the
                  hearse was to drive <del>i</del>up to the house.  He would not allow any of
                  this, he said:  "I can´t bear it and I won´t have it."
                  Mayor Enzinger drew a deep breath.  The first thing we had
                  to realise, he pointed out, was that the body had not yet been

                  released by the authorities.  In all cases where the cause of death
                  is not wholly clear certainkformalities are obligatory, and even
                  intervention at a high level would not work miracles.  Everything
                  takes time.  And how could anyone expect it of him, the Bürgermeister,
                  that he should refrain from notifying the Ministry and the Cultural
                  department of the Council of the <del>d</del>eeath of Professor _Auden?  It
                  was as much as his job was worth.  Now Frau Seitz spoke.  The
                  inhabitants of Kirchstetten, she believed, would hardly bury a dog
                  in the manner proposed by Herr Kallman, let alone a great poet.
                  Chester Kallman´s position was entirely comprehensible - to
                  some of us.  To him, an <del>E</del>American of Jewish origin and a non-believer,
                  the whole pomp and circumstance of a traditional Austrian funeral
                  was abhorrent.  Where prominent personages are concerned, there
                  would certainly be the local brass band, and where appropriate delegations representing
                  the voluntary fire brigade, the federal railways, the veterans´
                  association and others besides, and the gamekeepers would blow
                  their horns and wish him good hunting in the Elysian fields.
                  To Chester´s mind such folksy rituals were as foreign as the burial
                  rites of the Incas.  He did not know that not very long ago in
                  Lower Austria, Auden as a bachelor would have been accompanied in
                  the funeral procession by a "bride" dressed in white.  He was
                  unable to understand that his intentions were an intolerable affront
                  to the population of Kirchstetten.  In his despair, it certainly
                  never occurred to him that Auden himself would very likely have
                  been entranced at the idea of a slap-up funeral with all the
                  trimmings - one can almost hear his Olympian laughter - followed
                  by a hearty meal at the inn where he had so often <del>had</del>ate his l<del>i</del>unch.
                  As it turned out, Chester got no marks in local opinion for this
                  finale either, as the meal consisted of Leberkäs with vegetables:
                  This consisted of fried slices off a loaf of a flabby substance which is neither liver nor cheese related to the
                  Frankfurter sausage.  It is a
                  homely, juicy meal all too familiar to every Austrian;  a<del>b</del>nd it is
                  cheap.<del>n</del> There would be <del>mkuc</del> much talk of this also after all was over
                  For their part, the local people were forgetting that Chester was
                  probably in financial straits - not that this would have been taken
                  as an excuse.
                  For a moment the discussion had come to a standstill.

                  fetched more beer, Frau Strobl walked in and out and rolled a
                  baleful eye on us as she spoke into Chester´s ear.
                  The points at issue were not only When and How Much;  there
                  was also the matter of the church service and the prayers at the
                  graveside.  Many people in Akustria had assumed Auden to be of the
                  Roman Catholic faith;  he had of course remained <del>-</del>a:<del>s</del>member of the
                  Anglican and Episcopalian churche<del>e</del>s.  The misunderstanding arose
                  from his regular attendance at mass in the parish church and his
                  friendly relationship with Father Lustkandl, the parish priest
                  referred to in "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten".  Auden asked
                  Lustkandl´s sucessor for permission to be buried in the churchyard,
                  and his wish was accede<del>o</del>d to.   Evid<del>n</del>ently, <del>T</del>the next logical thing to do, then,
                  was to approach the chaplain to the British Embassy in Vienna,´
                  the Revd. Bruce Duncan, and ask him to officiate.  What form of
                  service this should be - there could be no question of a funeral
                  mass - left everyone present at a loss.  We agreed at last that
                  it ought to be some kind of ecumenical ceremony held jointly by
                  the two clergymen, but that first of all, the plan must be put
                  before D<del>D</del>r John Auden.
                  At this juncture Chester Kallman withdrew his insistence on
                  <del>an all too early funeral.</del>  the impossibly early date for the
                  funeral.  The room had become much too warm, the oxygen was
                  running out and Chester would not be able to stand much more
                  pressure.  The most urgent <del>step</del> objective waslquite simply to
                  free him from our burdensome presence.  Once everyone had agreed
                  that Auden´s relations must be told immediately that the funeral
                  <del>ah</del>had been postponed, the moment had come to dissolve the meeting.
                  Mrs Clark undertook to telephone to London and Frau Strobl would
                  drive her to the Post Office.  Chester asked me to talk everything
                  over with Frau Seitz and Herr Enzinger and reach definite concl<del>i</del>u-
                  sions.  We all stood up, Chester came across the room to me and
                  spoke in an undertone.  He was completely exhausted, he said,
                  he couldn´t stand much more.  "I´ll do anything you want, you
                  must just try to hold the others in check." Finally he said
                  "It´ll be all right, I´m crammed full of tranquillizers, all I
                  need is a bit of a rest."  He embraced me warmly and left the room.

                  the chief mourners.  It was "he-whose-name-we-never-mention";
                  or if it was, Chester had said, Auden crossed himself.
                  At the lowest point in Kirchstetten where the roads divide
                  thr procession halted while the coffin was transferred from the
                  hearse to a hand-drawn bier.  At this point the Church took charge
                  and the procession resumed its steady pace;  photographs exist
                  which were taken during the brief interval.
                  To British ears quite unremarkable, the ecumenic<del>la</del>al service
                  was much ta<del>o</del>Iked about in A<del>ku</del>ustrian circles because nothing of the
                  kind had been known <del>n</del>before.  The Revd. Bruce Du<del>o</del>ncan, today Rector
                  of Crediton in Devon, can remember little <del>more</del> about the general
                  circumstances but confirms that he used the Book of Common Prayer
                  and the long reading from the first <del>book</del>Letter of St.Paul to the
                  Corin<del>g</del>thians, chapter 15, verses 20-58. Beyond that, all he recalls
                  <del>is the hysterical behaviour </del> is his difficulties with Chester.
                  Reaching for my Authorised Version, for surely no one would
                  have dared to use any other, on second thoughts I also took out the
                  New Testament as translated into German by Martin Luther.  After
                  reading the English text through ve<del>d</del>ry slowly, and then a second
                  time, I did the same with the Luther<del>n</del>an Bible and lost in thought
                  compared the two, verse by verse.
                  "How nice to see you" said Auden who was sitting on one of the
                  white garden chairs with the red covers, "it´s a bit einsam here.
                  And I wanted to write and tell you that the technical word for
                  buddle is Erzwaschtrog.  I hope there is an equivalent German
                  euphemism for `senior citizen´.  Oh and adit is stollen, and although
                  I may be wrong, I guess concentrating mill is Vereinigungsmühle."
                  "What a mercy you´ve told me" I said, relieved.  "I should have
                  to have dug up such frightful words in the British Council library.
                  But do you think people will understand all that about the primary
                  and secondary worlds, or will they get muddled?"
                  "It´s perfectly simple" said Auden.  "The initial impulse to
                  create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by encounters,
                  in the primary world, with sacred beings or events."
                  "There is one glory of the sun" I heard myself say, "and
                  another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars:  for on

                  "Ah" he said, "you´ve been reading Corinthians One, chapter 15.
                  `Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.´ Chester and I took
                  that bidding rather too literally."
                  "Who would know where that familiar quotation comes from?"
                  I wondered.
                  "I would" said Auden.  "I´ve been looking up the German text.
                  Have you ever compared the Autho<del>s</del>rized Version with Martin Luther?"
                  "Funny you should ask that" I said.  "It´s one of the things
                  I forgot to talk to you about.  `Be not deceived:  evil<del>,</del>comm<del>ku</del>unica-

                  verführen!  Böse Geschwätze verderben gute Sitten.´"
                  "Very neat" said Auden happily.  I like `evil chatter´
                  better than `comm<del>k</del>unications´."
                  "The publishers" Isaid "have a rather heavy-handed way of
                  printing the more quotable bits in bold-face.  But in the next
                  verse Luther seems to flounder.  `Werdet doch einmal recht nüchtern
                  und sündiget nicht!´" Do be a bit sober for once, he pleads.  And
                  sin not.  King James´s translators fancied that St Paul cried out
                  <del>Ss</del>`Awake to righteousness!"
                  "Who knows what he really said."
                  "Luther´s language is very fine as he reaches the clim<del>x</del>ax:
                  `Siehe, ich sage euch ein Geheimnis... ´"
                  But Auden was speaking.  "Behold, I shew you a mystery:
                  we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment,
                  in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:  for the trumpet
                  shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we
                  shall be changed.´"  And with that he vanished.  Now wide awake, I
                  put the two books back on their shelf and settled down to re-type
                  Auden´s speech at Neulengbach.
                  Sehr verehrter Herr Landeshauptmann, Ladies and gentlemen:
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally.  I do so,
                  not out of vanity...

                  In Retrospect.<br />
                  Since then the Auden industry has not been idle.  An<br />
                  excellent biography was published1 and <del>i</del>kn this the Austrian<br />
                  period was dealt with but not locally researched.  Edward<br />
                  Mendelson edited Auden´s early works and wrote superb commentaries.<br />
                  There has been a biography of Chester Kallman.  Writers of PhD<br />
                  theses have been out here and have shaken us up, particularly<br />
                  Michael O´Sullivan of Trinity College, Dublin who - not spea<abbr title="unclear">k</abbr>ing<br />
                  a word of German - organised a full-scale exhibition and an<br />
                  international symposium in Vienna.  The editor of this volume<br />
                  Peter Müller had brought Michael out to see me at Fri<del>d</del>eau in the<br />
                  preceding year;  now he came again, and after the closure,<br />
                  exhausted, he spent a long weekend in the country to recover.<br />
                  We dug out ancient files containing original Auden manuscripts,<br />
                  letters, personal notes and newspaper cuttings, and now we tried<br />
                  to winnow the wheat from the chaff.  After some general discussion<br />
                  it seemed to us all that there remain certain aspects of Auden´s<br />
                  life in Lower Austria which are not on record, or where they are,<br />
                  not from the worm´s eye view.  As an older man he was happier<br />
                  here than anywhere else:  he felt at home.  He was at Kirchstette<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  not only during the summer, <del>i</del>as is often said, but with<br />
                  interruptions for five months, depending on his engagements.<br />
                  In the course of these years he was still highly <del>productive</del><br />
                  creative.  So that it might, we thought, be of value to put some<br />
                  of those things on record which would otherwise be lost.  Not<br />
                  for the first time self<del>.</del>-criticism was expressed, but while doubts<br />
                  concerning self-importance<del>as</del>and sell-out of f<del>i</del>riendship were not<br />
                  entirely banished, the view prevailed that the local witness<br />
                  needs to be put on paper.  Scholarship is at work elsewhere;<br />
                  here a few appendices and footnotes are on offer.<br />
                  Auden´s opinions on biographies of creative artists in general<br />
                  were, as Humphrey Carpenter pointed out, highly contradictory.<br />
                  Again and again he said that the private life of poets and other<br />
                  people engaged in creative work is none of the public´s business<br />
                  but he also said<abbr title="unclear">:</abbr>´`The biography of an artist, if his life as a w<abbr title="unclear">hole</abbr><br />
                  was sufficiently interesting, is permissible, provided that the<br />
                  biographer and his readers realise that such an account throws no<br />
                  light whatsoever upon the artist´s work."  And "I do believe,<br />
                  however, that, more often than most people realise, <del>k</del>his works<br />
                  may throw light upon his life."

                  Carpenter´s book calls itself "a first biography", and the<br />
                  author expressly restricts his aims:  "It is not a work of literary<br />
                  criticism".  It may also be felt to lack an analysis of some<br />
                  fundamental questions:  about the depths of the poet´s personality,<br />
                  his "otherness" (to confine this to his homosexuality would be to<br />
                  oversimplify) and the basis of his all-important relationship<br />
                  with Chester Kallman.  As a star<del>it</del>ting point, "Early Auden"1 which<br />
                  presents an<del>s</del>d comments on the poetry, drama and prose up to 1939<br />
                  is most valuable, and Edward Mendelson will produce further works<br />
                  of scholarship.<br />
                  What would Wystan Auden say if he could read "Auden in Love"<br />
                  by Chester´s old coll<del>a</del>ege friend and last-minute stepmother Dorothy<br />
                  J. Farnon?2  In July 1985 the Sunday Times published a list of<br />
                  recommended holiday <del>books</del> reading.  The assessment of "Auden in<br />
                  Love" was a model of compression:  "emetic but compulsive".<br />
                  I more than once came up against Auden´s idée fixe about the<br />
                  irrelevance of the poet´s private self, and asked him one day:<br />
                  "So no rotting apples in the desk drawer?"  "No, no rotting apples<br />
                  "And if you have an attack of the trots and interrupt your work?"<br />
                  "That would make no difference at all."  Chester´s sole explanatio<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  was that it was "a tick like any other", and that in any case he<br />
                  was totally inconsistent.  Be that as it may, if the effect on the<br />
                  general public was judged as emetic, Auden´s nausea can be<br />
                  imagined.  All the same, it is a fascinating book, and for people<br />
                  who knew the two men only in <del>r</del>the later years of their lives, does thro<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  light on apparently conflicting phenomena and makes their actions,<br />
                  and Chester´s character in particular, more comprehensible.<br />
                  When Auden first met Kallman he was just 32 and already a poet<br />
                  with an established reputation, respected and even revered on<br />

                  loved but who was already - though Auden did not know it -<br />
                  add<del>di</del><abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>cted to promiscuity.  In literature and music his knowledge<br />
                  was, for his age, above average, but when important examinations<br />
                  loomed a kind of petulant mood would come over him and he would<br />
                  fail to appear.<br />
                  Chester never wanted to earn his living, and all his life he wa<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  supported financially by other people, particularly by Auden.<br />
                  He usually promptly lost what he was given because he was<br />
                  perpetually being robbed by se<del>ö</del>amen picked up on the wharfs of<br />
                  New York.  By one of them he was robbed of three months´ income<br />
                  in succession.  Or else he gave it away:  no matter what actually<br />
                  happened, the money left his pocket.<br />
                  The scene shifts to a flat in the Esslingasse in Vienna´s<br />
                  3rd District, where Kallman once spent the winter.  He gave a<br />
                  party one evening, and afterwards I took two or three of the men<br />
                  part of t<del>i</del>heir way home in my car.  When Chester told me later on<br />
                  that the m<del>s</del>an who, as it chanced, had been sitting beside me, had<br />
                  gone off with 2,000 schillings taken out of the pocket of a<br />
                  jacket hanging on the bedroom door, I could not know that this<br />
                  was not a mere incident but almost a matter of routine.  When,<br />
                  ultimately, he took with him to Athens 80,000 sch. in cash<br />
                  (proceeds of the sale of a building plot) and lost it all on the<br />
                  way, this mishap was almost a foregone conclusion.<br />
                  That the sexual relationship between Auden and Kallman<br />
                  ceased as far back as 19<del>5</del>41 is well known:  from that time on -<br />
                  there is evidence in the poetry - sex and love became, for Auden,<br />
                  t<del>o</del>wo separate matters.  He felt married to Chester (when he was<br />
                  not Mother) for the rest of his life, and he wrote that Chester<br />
                  was the only person who, emotionally and intellectually, was<br />
                  wholly indispensable to him.<br />
                  Like it or not, this statement has to be accepted with all<br />
                  the weight it carries.  It was never possible, even in the<br />
                  Austrian era, to keep Chester in purdah for long, and when ther<abbr title="unclear">e</abbr><br />
                  was a visitor from Athens at Hinterholz 6 there could be tensio<del></del>n.<br />
                  Auden gave orders to Yannis Boras in the abrupt tones of a<br />
                  colonial Englishman of yore speaking to the "boy", and when I<br />
                  asked one day at lu<del>c</del>nch: "Where is, er....?" he said with a

                  smirk of satisfaction: "I sent him up on to the roof to mend tiles."<br />
                  But fundamentally nothing had changed between them:  this explains<br />
                  <del>his</del>Auden´s intense anxiety over the death of Boras in a car accident in<br />
                  Lower Austria, and his fear communicated itself to me as I searched<br />
                  for Chester in Vienna.  It was nearly Christmas, what on earth<br />
                  would become of him, distraught and alone?  (He had in fact not<br />
                  go<del>en</del>ne to Austria after all, but had not let Auden know.) There<br />
                  followed the gloomy summer <del>l</del>of 1969 when Chester was sunk in deep<br />
                  depression while Wyśtan had a full work programme, and when he<br />
                  told me he could hardly think how Chester would get through the<br />
                  summer1this was indeed Mother speaking.<br />
                  What was it in Chester Kallman that made him so entirely<br />
                  indispensable to Auden?  Perhaps the question is impossible to<br />
                  answer;  some may hold it to be inadmissible, or attempts to find<br />
                  points of reference impertinent.  Others again may find the whole<br />
                  subject unappetising.  But to anyone with an interest in psycholog<abbr title="unclear">y</abbr><br />
                  in the processes of cre<del>w</del><abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>tivity in general and in those of Auden<br />
                  in particular, there is no way of getting round this essential<br />
                  relationship.  It may, after all, come to be seen as one of the<br />
                  most curious in the history of English literature.<br />
                  In their love of music, of opera above all, Kallma<del>n</del>nwas in<br />
                  the lead.  He was a minor poet who wrote because he needed to do s<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  but his output was slight.  Yet in many spheres which were of<br />
                  intense interest to Auden he had little, sometimes nothing to offe<abbr title="unclear">r:</abbr><br />
                  German literature (though Chester picked <del>i</del>up languages with uncomm<abbr title="unclear">o</abbr>n<br />
                  facility; Wystan´s <del>G</del> spoken German was execrable but his compre-<br />
                  hension unerring), the history of cultures, religion and liturgy,<br />
                  translation.  When I was with them Wystan did not only most of the<br />
                  talking, but of the asking as well; his great charm lay in his<br />
                  alert interest in other people´s work, and he would draw one out<br />
                  on the odder backwaters of Austrian history.  This side of him com<abbr title="unclear">e</abbr>s<br />

                  afternoon, Kallman was silent.  Kallman lacked Auden´s sensitivit<abbr title="unclear">y</abbr><br />
                  to places and people, <del>ot</del> to the genius loci;  perhaps it was just<br />

                  lost his roots in Europe.<br />
                  On his own ground, operatic libretti, Chester Kallman was<br />
                  still in good running order, and when the Rake´s Progress was put<br />
                  on in Vienna he wrote a letter to Die Presse protesting sharply<br />
                  <del>over</del>against the cuts <del>which had been</del> made by the producer.  But of that<br />
                  conversational brilliance which old friends have described there<br />
                  was little sign.  A scene comes to mind: Auden was away, and Chester<br />
                  asked me to meet him for lunch at a restaurant off the Kärntner-<br />
                  strasse.  A young man whose background clearly lay somewhere<br />
                  within the crime belt near the Prater was with him, and soon the<br />
                  youth <del></del>sand I were engrossed in conversation, while Chester, feeling<br />
                  out of it, sulked.  Immediately after coffee it seemed best to<br />
                  leave them.  Chester´s intelligence and wit had not deserted him<br />
                  but they had too little scope, and, perhaps owing to his carp-like<br />
                  appearance, he was liable to be underestimated.  He was good-natured,<br />
                  in course of time even affectionate, hospitable and amusing.  He<br />
                  looked after Auden devotedly and we know that he was able to banish<br />
                  Auden´s loneliness as no one else could.  His misfortune was that<br />
                  he lacked those qualities which Auden possessed and which decide<br />
                  between success and failure.<br />
                  It cannot, all the same, have been easy living on a long-term<br />
                  basis with Auden in New Yo<del>r</del>wk while attempting, even though<br />
                  fitfully, to develop his own personality and talents.  Putting up with Auden´s<br />
                  fads, his insistence on punctuality and the rigid routine was one<br />
                  thing;  to grow up, to mature in the shadow of this oversized tree<br />
                  was another.  There was not enough light.  So he fled, but without<br />
                  Mother there was no way he could live at all.<br />
                  It is essentia<del>sl</del>l, in the light of what happened later on, to<br />
                  remember Auden´s generosity.  His biographer mentioned the two boys<br />
                  whose further education was financed by Auden:  I can confirm this<br />
                  as we lived next door to them for a few years.  They were the sons of<br />
                  an artist;  both made rapid careers in industrial management.  But<br />
                  there were other examples.  Wyst<del>s</del><abbr title="unclear">a</abbr>n had telephoned and asked me to<br />
                  meet him and Chester at the Operncafé - the much-missed café-<br />
                  restaurant next to the Opera, now a car salesroom.  They were waiting<br />
                  for Balanchine to join them after the performance, but we waited in<br />
                  vain and fi<del>kn</del><abbr title="unclear">na</abbr>lly gave up and went home.  There was a fourth at our<br />
                  table, a silent young man who, Chester said in an undertone, was<br />
                  a student of technology and Wyst<del>sa</del><abbr title="unclear">an</abbr> was helping with his studies.

                  It turned out that he lived not far from my flat so we drove<br />
                  off together, and he suddenly broke his silence to ask:  "Who<br />
                  is this Professor Auden - is he well known?"<br />
                  There was a brief flurry after the 1968 uprising in<br />
                  Czechoslovakia.  Towards the end of Auden´s summer residence at

                  Kirchstetten the question cropped <del>i</del>up whether he would be willing<br />
                  to lend the house to a Czech refugee and his wife.  By mid-<br />
                  October Auden was in England, and he wrote from London, c/o<br />
                  Heyworth, 32 Bryanston Square:
               </p><p>
                  Dear Stella, Got back from Oxford yesterday and found your<br />
                  letter waiting.  1) I think I ought to take the couple in,<br />
                  but I m<del>k</del>ust leave it to you to decide whether they are O.K.<br />
                  If they are, all rooms, including my study (which can´t be<br />
                  heated) are open to them.  2)  How m<del>ku</del>uch money will they need<br />
                  to keep going?  And how shall I make the arrangements for<br />
                  payment.  3) Will they be able to find work or emigrate<br />
                  before I return in April, when I´m afraid there will not<br />
                  be room for them?  4) I´m worried about how they will get<br />
                  gas cylinders for cooking from Neulengbach, since, presumably,<br />
                  they have no car.  I expect someone in the village will help.<br />
                  5)  If and when they come, I must know in advance so that I<br />
                  can write a note to the Burgom<del>a</del>eister..." (sic).

                  Dear Stella,<br />
                  Many thanks for your letter.  Of course,<br />
                  selfishly, I´m rather relieved.  How horrid<br />
                  one is!<br />
                  The U.S. is grim.<br />

               </p><p>
                  Great generosity (these facts, even separately, are known<br />
                  to no more than two or three people) <del>ed  existed</del>combined in Auden´s<br />
                  character quite readily with his legendary stinginess in the<br />
                  small things of everyday life such as stamps or cigarettes.<br />
                  "Life" magazine, he told me one day with a beaming smile, had<br />
                  just paid him 5,000 dolla<del>sr</del><abbr title="unclear">r</abbr>s for an article.  "I´m thinking<br />
                  of building on a diningroom."  "Very good idea" I said,<br />
                  "but for a start I shall smoke your cigarettes for the rest of<br />
                  the afternoon."  I very much doubt whether I did.  On the other<br />
                  hand he would order things to be sent out from Vienna <del>a</del>without<br />
                  a second thought.  After his car accident he sent me a message<br />
                  and I drove out to Kirchstetten.  He was dishevelled and cross.<br />
                  It´s a curious thing, he said, but the first chap <del>you see</del> who<br />
                  takes any notice of you when you´re carried into hospital is not

                  know how you propose to pay for your treatment.  No, he said,<br />
                  he didn´t really need anything and Chester would arrive shortly,<br />
                  but he was running out of gin.   If I´d be an angel and ring<br />
                  up Wild on the Neuer Markt and ask them to send a few bottles out -<br />
                  he told me the brand name - that would be splendid.<br />
                  When the friendly voice on the end of the line had repeated<br />
                  the order I<del>ö</del>asked when they would be making their next delivery<br />
                  in the area around Kirchstetten.  "Oh but we never deliver out<br />
                  there" said the voice, "We make a special trip for the Herr<br />
                  Professor."  Startled, I exclaimed "For goodness´ sake, that must<br />
                  cost him a packet - you can buy that brand of gin in Böheimkirchen!"<br />
                  "Certainly you can" said the voice which now sounded amused,<br />
                  "but why do we have to worry our heads over the way a Herr<br />
                  Profess<del>s</del><abbr title="unclear">o</abbr>r flings his money around?"  I liked the "we".<br />

                  but m<del>u</del>kst still have been common parlance in Kirchstetten.<br />
                  There was a tidy line-up consisting of fridge, sink, low<br />
                  cupboards providing a good working surface,,a corner <del>f</del>cupboard<br />
                  the interior of which s<del>x</del>wung out, and a gas stove.  Both men were<br />
                  very proud of the kitchen and it became Chester´s habitat.<br />
                  But the whole point of a modern kitchen:  the labour-saving<br />
                  working area, ample storage space, accessibility, was totally<br />
                  cancelled out by the permanent clutter.  It was a matter of<br />
                  principle with Chester to have all cooking ingredients con<del>c</del>veniently<br />
                  to hand, which meant that nothing was ever put away, and where<br />
                  his loving eye saw method, even the least fussy visitor could<br />
                  only see a shambles.  But an interesting shambles owing to the<br />
                  exotic nature of the preserved foods and spices which Chester<br />
                  brought with him.  There was <del>a</del> for example a dried leaf which,<br />
                  detected by me in a casserole, was said to have no flavour but<br />
                  to serve as a stimulus or bridge to other flavours.<br />
                  It was clear from the beginning that the two of them were<br />
                  not so much drinking as eating their way into their graves <del>i</del>owing

                  Whether or not - and Chester was convinced that this was so -<br />
                  the business about alleged arrears of income tax shortened Auden´s<br />
                  life must be left open.  The "Declaration" to the tax authorities<br />
                  in which a great poet patiently explains how poetry comes to be<br />
                  written must be unique and deserves a place in the history of<br />
                  literature.
               </p><p>
                  Declaration. 1<br />
                  Gentlemen,<br />
                  My position is very simple: one pays income tax where one<br />
                  earns money, that is to say in my case, as a writer writing in<br />
                  English, in the United States and in England.  In Austria I<br />
                  earn not one groschen, I merely spend sch<del>i</del>ullings.<br />
                  You maintain that I possess a "material interest" in Austria,<br />
                  by which you presumably mean a "financial" interest.  That might<br />
                  conceivably be the case if I had to say to myself:  "I must go<br />
                  to Austria because I can only work in Austria!"  But that is not<br />
                  the case.  I have lived in many places in many different countries<br />
                  and was always able <del>e</del>to work wherever I might be.<br />
                  I naturally have a "p<del>öe</del><abbr title="unclear">er</abbr>sonal" interest in Austria, otherwise<br />
                  I should not come here.  The landscape is pleasing, and I find<br />
                  the Austrians whose acquaintance I have made, friendly an<abbr title="unclear">sd</abbr><br />
                  charming.<br />
                  You say correctly that I once received <del>n</del>an Austrian prize<br />
                  for lieterature.  This was a great honour of which I am very<br />
                  proud.  You cannot however serioiusly believe, Gentlemen, that I<br />
                  calculated:  "If I continue to go to Austria maybe I shall be<br />
                  given a prize"?  Until it was awarded to me I had never heard<br />
                  of <del>the</del>this prize.  It is equally clear that I cannot receive it a

                  second time.  You also go on to say that a road in Kirchstetten<br />
                  has been named Audenstraße after me.  That was a very kind gesture<br />
                  on the part of the local council, but it cannot be maintaine<del>d</del>sd<br />
                  that I profit from it <del>i</del>financially.<br />
                  Further, you say with truth that I have written several poems<br />
                  <del>in A</del> <del>with</del>o<del>j</del>n Austrian themes.  To this I would like to make three<br />
                  statements.<br />
                  1.  I have never, in Austria, received so much as one<br />
                  penny for my poems.  One or two of them have been trans-<br />
                  lated into German, but in these cases the translators have<br />
                  received the money, not I.<br />
                  2.  I believe you are not clearly aware how poetry comes<br />
                  to be written.  What is generally taken to be the subject<br />
                  matter is only a viewpoint, an occasion whereby certain<br />
                  thoughts about nature, God, history, mankind etc. may be<br />
                  expressed which the poet may have had in mind for a very<br />
                  long time.  I wrote, for example, a poem to commemorate the<br />
                  20th anniversary of the death of Josef Weinheber.<br />
                  Fundamentally however the poem is concerned with quite<br />
                  different things.  First of all it is about the love<br />
                  which every poet, whatever his nationality, has for his<br />
                  mother tongue, and secondly about what happened after the<br />
                  war in the countries which were defeated, i.e. not only<br />
                  in Austria but in Germany and Italy.  Again:  in 1964<br />
                  I wrote a poem with the title "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten"<br />
                  because it was where I happ<del>p</del>ened to be.  But the place is<br />
                  unimportant.  In real<del>t</del>ity the question in this poem is<br />
                  what, for a Christian, is the meaning of the Feast of<br />
                  Pentecost.  And this is valid for all countries in the<br />
                  same way.<br />
                  3.  I believe you do not clearly recognize a poet´s (Dichte<abbr title="unclear">r</abbr>)<br />
                  financial s<del>k</del>ituation.  If he is suc<del>e</del><abbr title="unclear">c</abbr>essful, a novelist<br />
                  can ma<del>,</del>ke a good deal of money.  A poet (Lyriker) cannot,<br />
                  even if he is very well known, because he is only read<br />
                  by a minority.  By far the greater part of my income<br />
                  comes not from the sale of my volumes of poetry but from<br />
                  book reviews, translations, lectures etc., activities<br />
                  which have nothing to do with Austria.  A<del>m</del><abbr title="unclear">n</abbr>d while we are

                  on the subject of translation<del>:</del>s  you rightly say that<br />
                  I have a great int<del>r</del>erest in German and Austrian literatu<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  I may add in music as well - but I do not have to come<br />
                  to Austria in order to read or to hear them.<br />
                  You see f<del>ero</del><abbr title="unclear">rom</abbr> all <del>the above</del> this that the arguments brought<br />
                  forward by you for subjecting me to payment of income tax are not<br />
                  valid.  The most pertinent argument against it is that in the<br />
                  course of one year I always stay under six months in Austri<del>sa</del><abbr title="unclear">aa</abbr><br />
                  and never spend more than three months here consecutively.<br />
                  A word in conclusion: if this in my view entirely unjustifiable<br />
                  nonsense does not cease, I shall leave Austria never to return,<br />
                  which would be very sad for me and perhaps too for the shopkeepers<br />
                  <del>i</del>of Kirchstetten.  One thing, Gentlemen, I cannot conceal from you:<br />
                  if this should happen it m<del>i</del>kght give rise to a scandal of worldwide<br />
                  dimensions.<br />

               </p><p>   
                  1 You ask why I have made over my half of our property in<br />
                  Kirchstetten to Mr Chester Kallman who is not related to me.<br />
                  Mr Kallman is my heir.  I have no children and for years past<br />
                  he has been my literary collaborator.  <del>s</del>Jointly, we have written<br />
                  five new opera libretti, "The Rake´s Progress, "Elegy for Young<br />
                  Lovers", "The Bassarids_" and "Love´s Labours Lost".  And<br />
                  together we have made new translations of "The MagiccFlute",<br />
                  "Don Giovanni", "Die Sieben Todsünden", "Mahagonny" and<br />
                  "Archifanfaro".  I am now 65 years old and must reckon with all<br />
                  eventualities such as a heart attack.  As you know better than<br />
                  I, in the event of sudden death great difficulties arise for the<br />
                  heirs to landed property, particularly in a foreign country.

                  "Every day f<del>p</del>or the past year" said Chester "I have stood<br />
                  outside his door in the early morning, afraid to go in."<br />
                  This was later.  Now, Auden was dead, the voice issuing<br />
                  from the car radio had just said so.  A few days ago we had<br />
                  talked about his reading in the Society for Literature on 28<br />
                  September.  Unfortunately, I said, I was obliged to drive to<br />
                  Linz and to spend the n<del>i</del>kght there, but they were welcome to use<br />
                  my Vienna flat.  It was maddening and I would just as soon<br />
                  put it off.  No, said Auden, mustn´t do that, one should stick<br />
                  to one´s commitments.  "And you won´t be missing much" he<br />
                  reassured me, "you´ve heard it all before."  We would meet again<br />
                  in a few days´time and then he would tell me all about it.  He was<br />
                  not sure about the fla<del>as</del>t but he would let me know in good time.<br />
                  On 24 September he wrote a note to say that he did not need the<br />
                  flat, he would go to the Hotel Altenburgerhof.  The handwriting<br />
                  is ragged.<br />
                  Linz already lay far behind, the car radio went on m<del>k</del>uttering<br />
                  to itself unheeded until the familiar voice of Friedrich Hee<del>ee</del>r<del></del>r<abbr title="unclear"></abbr><br />
                  came through, reading one of his book reviews.  It was consoling<br />
                  in a world where, suddenly, a signpost was missing.  W<del>j</del>hat are<br />
                  you howling about, I asked myself, what gives you the right to<br />
                  mourn for Wystan?  Think of Chester.  It was impossible not to<br />
                  think of Chester:  it was not so much a question how much he<br />
                  would grieve over the death of Wystan, as how he would survive<br />
                  at all.  Leaving the autobahn at St.Pölten I drove straight to<br />
                  Kirchstetten;  it seemed to be just possible that he might have<br />
                  arrived in the meantime.  But the green shutters were closed<br />
                  and there was no one about apart from the wall-eyed dog, an<br />
                  exceptionally hideous mongrel belonging to Frau Strobl, which<br />
                  barked in an irritating falsetto.  He barked from a position close<br />
                  beside me while I wrote a note and stuck it in the chink between<br />
                  the door´s shutters, and he was still barking as I shut the<br />
                  garden gate behind me.<br />
                  The answer to my note was a telephone call from Frau Strobl:<br />
                  Herr Kallman said, would I come over to tea the next day?<br />
                  That was the Sunday.

                  The sittingroom seemed to be full of people.  <del>-</del>Chester was<br />
                  sitting on the corner-seat facing the door, where Auden always<br />
                  used to sit, every <del>seat</del>chair appeared to be occupied and two young<br />
                  men were sitting <del>in the back</del> on the floor.  Chester hurried<br />
                  across the room, hugged me and said "The whole thing´s terrible,<br />
                  you have to help me."<br />
                  I was introduced to the others.  Mrs. Thekla Clark and her<br />
                  daughter had come up from Florence as soon<del>a</del>as t<del>e</del>hey heard the<br />
                  news;  there was Frau Maria Seitz, headmistress of the high school;<br />
                  <del>in Kirchstetten, the mayor Herr Enzinger</del> Herr Enzinger the mayor<br />
                  of Kirchstetten, <del>a</del>the film scriptwriter Adolf Opel, and the young men.<br />
                  Clearly, the meeting to discuss the funeral arra<del>n</del>ggements was<br />
                  not proceeding smoothly.  The mayor looked annoyed, Frau Seitz<br />
                  looked worried and Mrs Clark bewildered.  There were, of course,<br />
                  language difficulties.  Mayor Enzinger spoke not a word of<br />
                  <del>G</del>English and the Clarks no German, while the headmistress had a<br />
                  certain command of English but did not feel up to acting as<br />
                  interpreter and adviser in one;  Chester´a German was perfect<del>k</del><abbr title="unclear">l</abbr>y<br />
                  adequate.<br />
                  The root of the problem lay on a deeper level, where two<br />
                  separate cultures collided head on.  Chester was barely coherent,<br />
                  but he managed to explain his point of view.  He loathed, from<br />
                  the bottom of his hearteverything in the way of pompes funèbres.<br />
                  He wanted to bury Aud<del>s</del><abbr title="unclear">e</abbr>n, he said, quietly and privately and, if<br />
                  it could possibly be managed, on Tuesday.  He had already informed<br />
                  Wyst<del>s</del>an´s brother Dr. John Auden, Stephen Spender and <del>os</del>others<br />
                  of the arran<del>t</del>gements and asked them to arrive, if not tomorrow,<br />
                  then on Tuesday morning at the latest.  On the other hand the<br />
                  mayor of Kirchstetten, he went on, wanted to lay on a really big<br />
                  show with brass bands and all the rest of it, and what was more<br />
                  on the Saturday to give as many people as possible the chance to<br />
                  come.  The Ministry of Education and the provincial council of<br />
                  Lower Austria were to be represented, and as the last straw the<br />
                  hearse was to drive <del>i</del>up to the house.  He would not allow any of<br />
                  this, he said:  "I can´t bear it and I won´t have it."<br />
                  Mayor Enzinger drew a deep breath.  The first thing we had<br />
                  to realise, he pointed out, was that the body had not yet been

                  released by the authorities.  In all cases where the cause of death<br />
                  is not wholly clear certain<abbr title="unclear">k</abbr>formalities are obligatory, and even<br />
                  intervention at a high level would not work miracles.  Everything<br />
                  takes time.  And how could anyone expect it of him, the Bürgermeister<abbr title="unclear">,</abbr><br />
                  that he should refrain from notifying the Ministry and the Cultural<br />
                  department of the Council of the <del>d</del>eeath of Professor _Auden?  It<br />
                  was as much as his job was wor<abbr title="unclear">t</abbr>h.  Now Frau Seitz spoke.  The<br />
                  inhabitants of Kirchstetten, she believed, would hardly bury a dog<br />
                  in the manner proposed by Herr Kallman, let alone a great poet.<br />
                  Chester Kallman´s position was entirely comprehensible - to<br />
                  some of us.  To him, an <del>E</del>American of Jewish origin and a non-believer,<br />
                  the whole pomp and circumstance of a traditional Austrian funeral<br />
                  was abhorrent.  Where prominent personages are concerned, there<br />
                  would certainly be the local brass band, and where appropr<abbr title="unclear">i</abbr>a<abbr title="unclear">te</abbr> delegations representing<br />
                  the voluntary fire brigade, the federal railways, the veterans´<br />
                  association and others besides, and the gamekeepers would blow<br />
                  their horns and wish him good hunting in the Elysian fields.<br />
                  To Chester´s mind such folksy rituals were as foreign as the burial<br />
                  rites of the Incas.  He did not know that not very long ago in<br />
                  Lower Austria, Auden as a bachelor would have been accompanied in<br />
                  the funeral procession by a "bride" dressed in white.  He was<br />
                  unable to understand that his intentions were an intolerable affront<br />
                  to the population of Kirchstetten.  In his despair, it certainly<br />
                  never occurred to him that Auden himself would very likely have<br />
                  been entranced at the idea of a slap-up funeral with all the<br />
                  trimmings - one can almost hear his Olympian laughter - followed<br />
                  by a hearty meal at the inn where he had so often <del>had</del>ate his l<del>i</del>unch.<br />
                  As it turned out, Chester got no marks in local opinion for this<br />
                  finale either, as the meal consisted of Leberkäs with vegetables:<br />
                  <abbr title="unclear">T</abbr>his consisted of fried slices off a loaf of a flabby substance which is neither liver nor cheese related to the<br />
                  Frankfurter sausage.  It is a<br />
                  homely, juicy meal all too familiar to every Austrian;  a<del>b</del>nd it is<br />
                  cheap.<del>n</del> There would be <del>mkuc</del> much talk of this also after all was ove<abbr title="unclear">r</abbr><br />
                  For their part, the local people were forgetting that Chester was<br />
                  probably in financial straits - not that this would have been taken<br />
                  as an excuse.<br />
                  For a moment the discussion had come to a standstill.<br />
                  <del>XT</del>The young men who took no part in it and conversed in whispers,

                  fetched more beer, Frau Strobl walked in and out and rolled a<br />
                  baleful eye on us as she spoke into Chester´s ear.<br />
                  The points at issue were not only When and How Much;  there<br />
                  was also the matter of the church service and the prayers at the<br />
                  graveside.  Many people in Akustria had assumed Auden to be of the<br />
                  Roman Catholic faith;  he had of course remained <del>-</del>a:<del>s</del>member of the<br />
                  Anglican and Episcopalian churche<del>e</del>s.  The misunderstanding arose<br />
                  from his regular attendance at mass in the parish church and his<br />
                  friendly relationship with Father Lustkandl, the parish priest<br />
                  referred to in "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten".  Auden asked<br />
                  Lustkandl´s sucessor for permission to be buried in the churchyard,<br />
                  and his wish was accede<del>o</del><abbr title="unclear">d</abbr> to.   Evid<del>n</del>ently<abbr title="unclear">,</abbr> <del>T</del>the next <abbr title="unclear">l</abbr>ogical thing to do, then,<br />
                  was to approach the chaplain to the British Embassy in Vienna,´<br />
                  the Revd. Bruce Duncan, and ask him to officiate.  What form of<br />
                  service this should be - there could be no question of a funeral<br />
                  mass - left everyone present at a loss.  We agreed at last that<br />
                  it ought to be some kind of ecumenical ceremony held jointly by<br />
                  the two clergymen, but that first of all, the plan must be put<br />
                  before D<del>D</del>r John Auden.<br />
                  At this juncture Chester Kallman withdrew his insistence on<br />
                  <del>an all too early funeral.</del>  the impossibly early date for the<br />
                  funeral.  The room had become much too warm, the oxygen was<br />
                  running out and Chester would not be able to stand much more<br />
                  pressure.  The most urgent <del>step</del> objective waslquite simply to<br />
                  free him from our burdensome presence.  Once everyone had agreed<br />
                  that Auden´s relations must be told immediately that the funeral<br />
                  <del>ah</del>had been postponed, the moment had come to dissolve the meeting.<br />
                  Mrs Clark undertook to telephone to London and Frau Strobl would<br />
                  drive her to the Post Office.  Chester asked me to talk everything<br />
                  over with Frau Seitz and Herr Enzinger and reach definite concl<del>i</del>u-<br />
                  sions.  We all stood up, Chester came across the room to me and<br />
                  spoke in an undertone.  He was completely exhausted, he said,<br />
                  he couldn´t stand much more.  "I´ll do anything you want, you<br />
                  must just try to hold the others in check." Finally he said<br />
                  "It´ll be all right, I´m crammed full of tranquillizers, all I<br />
                  need is a bit of a rest."  He embraced me warmly and left the room.

                  the chief mourners.  It was "he-whose-name-we-never-mention";<br />
                  or if it was, Chester had said, Auden crossed himself.<br />
                  At the lowest point in Kirchstetten where the roads divide<br />
                  thr procession halted while the coffin was transferred from the<br />
                  hearse to a hand-drawn bier.  At this point the Church took charge<br />
                  and the procession resumed its steady pace;  photographs exist<br />
                  which were taken during the brief interval.<br />
                  To British ears quite unremarkable, the ecumenic<del>la</del>al service<br />
                  was much ta<del>o</del>Iked about in A<del>ku</del>ustrian circles because nothing of the<br />
                  kind had been known <del>n</del>before.  The Revd. Bruce Du<del>o</del>ncan, today Rector<br />
                  of Crediton in Devon, can remember little <del>more</del> about the general<br />
                  circumstances but confirms that he used the Book of Common Prayer<br />
                  and the long reading from the first <del>book</del>Letter of St.Paul to the<br />
                  Corin<del>g</del>thians, chapter 15, verses 20-58. Beyond that, all he recalls<br />
                  <del>is the hysterical behaviour </del> is his difficulties with Chester.<br />
                  Reaching for my Authorised Version, for surely no one would<br />
                  have dared to use any other, on second thoughts I also took out the<br />
                  New Testament as translated into German by Martin Luther.  After<br />
                  reading the English text through ve<del>d</del>ry slowly, and then a second<br />
                  time, I did the same with the Luther<del>n</del>an Bible and lost in thought<br />
                  compared the two, verse by verse.<br />
                  "How nice to see you" said Auden who was sitting on one of the<br />
                  white garden chairs with the red covers, "it´s a bit einsam here.<br />
                  And I wanted to write and tell you that the technical word for<br />
                  buddle is Erzwaschtrog.  I hope there is an equivalent German<br />
                  euphemism for `senior citizen´.  Oh and adit is stollen, and although<br />
                  I may be wrong, I guess concentrating mill is Vereinigungsmühle."<br />
                  "What a mercy you´ve told me" I said, relieved.  "I should have<br />
                  to have dug up such frightful words in the British Council library.<br />
                  But do you think people will understand all that about the primary<br />
                  and secondary worlds, or will they get muddled?"<br />
                  "It´s perfectly simple" said Auden.  "The initial impulse to<br />
                  create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by encounters,<br />
                  in the primary world, with sacred beings or events."<br />
                  "There is one glory of the sun" I heard myself say, "and<br />
                  another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars:  for on

                  star differeth from another in glory."<br />
                  "Ah" he said, "you´ve been reading Corinthians One, chapter 15.<br />
                  `Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.´ Chester and I took<br />
                  that bidding rather too literally."<br />
                  "Who would know where that familiar quotation comes from?"<br />
                  I wondered.<br />
                  "I would" said Auden.  "I´ve been looking up the German text.<br />
                  Have you ever compared the Autho<del>s</del>rized Version with Martin Luther?"<br />
                  "Funny you should ask that" I said.  "It´s one of the things<br />
                  I forgot to talk to you about.  `Be not deceived:  evil<del>,</del>comm<del>ku</del>unica-<br />
                  tions corrupt good manners.´ He renders that as <abbr title="unclear">`L</abbr>asset euch nicht<br />
                  verführen!  Böse Geschwätze verderben gute Sitten.´"<br />
                  "Very neat" said Auden happily.  I like `evil chatter´<br />
                  better than `comm<del>k</del>unications´."<br />
                  "The publishers" Isaid "have a rather heavy-handed way of<br />
                  printing the more quotable bits in bold-face.  But in the next<br />
                  verse Luther seems to flounder.  `Werdet doch einmal recht nüchtern<br />
                  und sündiget nicht!<abbr title="unclear">´"</abbr> Do be a bit sober for once, he pleads.  And<br />
                  sin not.  King James´s translators fancied that St Paul cried out<br />
                  <del>Ss</del>`Awake to righteousness!"<br />
                  "Who knows what he really said."<br />
                  "Luther´s language is very fine as he reaches the clim<del>x</del>ax:<br />
                  `Siehe, ich sage euch ein Geheimnis... ´"<br />
                  But Auden was speaking.  "Behold, I shew you a mystery:<br />
                  we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment,<br />
                  in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:  for the trumpet<br />
                  shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we<br />
                  shall be changed.´"  And with that he vanished.  Now wide awake, I<br />
                  put the two books back on their shelf and settled down to re-type<br />
                  Auden´s speech at Neulengbach.<br />
                  Sehr verehrter Herr Landeshauptmann, Ladies and gentlemen:<br />
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally.  I do so,<br />
                  not out of vanity...
