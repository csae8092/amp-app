                  In Retrospect.<lb/>
                  Since then the Auden industry has not been idle.  An<lb/>
                  excellent biography was published1 and <del>i</del>kn this the Austrian<lb/>
                  period was dealt with but not locally researched.  Edward<lb/>
                  Mendelson edited Auden´s early works and wrote superb commentaries.<lb/>
                  There has been a biography of Chester Kallman.  Writers of PhD<lb/>
                  theses have been out here and have shaken us up, particularly<lb/>
                  Michael O´Sullivan of Trinity College, Dublin who - not spea<unclear>k</unclear>ing<lb/>
                  a word of German - organised a full-scale exhibition and an<lb/>
                  international symposium in Vienna.  The editor of this volume<lb/>
                  Peter Müller had brought Michael out to see me at Fri<del>d</del>eau in the<lb/>
                  preceding year;  now he came again, and after the closure,<lb/>
                  exhausted, he spent a long weekend in the country to recover.<lb/>
                  We dug out ancient files containing original Auden manuscripts,<lb/>
                  letters, personal notes and newspaper cuttings, and now we tried<lb/>
                  to winnow the wheat from the chaff.  After some general discussion<lb/>
                  it seemed to us all that there remain certain aspects of Auden´s<lb/>
                  life in Lower Austria which are not on record, or where they are,<lb/>
                  not from the worm´s eye view.  As an older man he was happier<lb/>
                  here than anywhere else:  he felt at home.  He was at Kirchstette<unclear></unclear><lb/>
                  not only during the summer, <del>i</del>as is often said, but with<lb/>
                  interruptions for five months, depending on his engagements.<lb/>
                  In the course of these years he was still highly <del>productive</del><lb/>
                  creative.  So that it might, we thought, be of value to put some<lb/>
                  of those things on record which would otherwise be lost.  Not<lb/>
                  for the first time self<del>.</del>-criticism was expressed, but while doubts<lb/>
                  concerning self-importance<del><del><unclear>a</unclear></del>s</del>and sell-out of f<del>i</del>riendship were not<lb/>
                  entirely banished, the view prevailed that the local witness<lb/>
                  needs to be put on paper.  Scholarship is at work elsewhere;<lb/>
                  here a few appendices and footnotes are on offer.<lb/>
                  Auden´s opinions on biographies of creative artists in general<lb/>
                  were, as Humphrey Carpenter pointed out, highly contradictory.<lb/>
                  Again and again he said that the private life of poets and other<lb/>
                  people engaged in creative work is none of the public´s business<lb/>
                  but he also said<unclear>:</unclear>´`The biography of an artist, if his life as a w<unclear>hole</unclear><lb/>
                  was sufficiently interesting, is permissible, provided that the<lb/>
                  biographer and his readers realise that such an account throws no<lb/>
                  light whatsoever upon the artist´s work."  And "I do believe,<lb/>
                  however, that, more often than most people realise, <del>k</del>his works<lb/>
                  may throw light upon his life."

                  Carpenter´s book calls itself "a first biography", and the<lb/>
                  author expressly restricts his aims:  "It is not a work of literary<lb/>
                  criticism".  It may also be felt to lack an analysis of some<lb/>
                  fundamental questions:  about the depths of the poet´s personality,<lb/>
                  his "otherness" (to confine this to his homosexuality would be to<lb/>
                  oversimplify) and the basis of his all-important relationship<lb/>
                  with Chester Kallman.  As a star<del>it</del>ting point, "Early Auden"1 which<lb/>
                  presents an<del>s</del>d comments on the poetry, drama and prose up to 1939<lb/>
                  is most valuable, and Edward Mendelson will produce further works<lb/>
                  of scholarship.<lb/>
                  What would Wystan Auden say if he could read "Auden in Love"<lb/>
                  by Chester´s old coll<del>a</del>ege friend and last-minute stepmother Dorothy<lb/>
                  J. Farnon?2  In July 1985 the Sunday Times published a list of<lb/>
                  recommended holiday <del>books</del> reading.  The assessment of "Auden in<lb/>
                  Love" was a model of compression:  "emetic but compulsive".<lb/>
                  I more than once came up against Auden´s idée fixe about the<lb/>
                  irrelevance of the poet´s private self, and asked him one day:<lb/>
                  "So no rotting apples in the desk drawer?"  "No, no rotting apples<lb/>
                  "And if you have an attack of the trots and interrupt your work?"<lb/>
                  "That would make no difference at all."  Chester´s sole explanatio<unclear></unclear><lb/>
                  was that it was "a tick like any other", and that in any case he<lb/>
                  was totally inconsistent.  Be that as it may, if the effect on the<lb/>
                  general public was judged as emetic, Auden´s nausea can be<lb/>
                  imagined.  All the same, it is a fascinating book, and for people<lb/>
                  who knew the two men only in <del>r</del>the later years of their lives, does thro<unclear></unclear><lb/>
                  light on apparently conflicting phenomena and makes their actions,<lb/>
                  and Chester´s character in particular, more comprehensible.<lb/>
                  When Auden first met Kallman he was just 32 and already a poet<lb/>
                  with an established reputation, respected and even revered on<lb/>
                  many a campus.  Kallman was an 18 year old undergraduate,<lb/>

                  loved but who was already - though Auden did not know it -<lb/>
                  add<del>di</del><unclear>i</unclear>cted to promiscuity.  In literature and music his knowledge<lb/>
                  was, for his age, above average, but when important examinations<lb/>
                  loomed a kind of petulant mood would come over him and he would<lb/>
                  fail to appear.<lb/>
                  Chester never wanted to earn his living, and all his life he wa<unclear></unclear><lb/>
                  supported financially by other people, particularly by Auden.<lb/>
                  He usually promptly lost what he was given because he was<lb/>
                  perpetually being robbed by se<del>ö</del>amen picked up on the wharfs of<lb/>
                  New York.  By one of them he was robbed of three months´ income<lb/>
                  in succession.  Or else he gave it away:  no matter what actually<lb/>
                  happened, the money left his pocket.<lb/>
                  The scene shifts to a flat in the Esslingasse in Vienna´s<lb/>
                  3rd District, where Kallman once spent the winter.  He gave a<lb/>
                  party one evening, and afterwards I took two or three of the men<lb/>
                  part of t<del>i</del>heir way home in my car.  When Chester told me later on<lb/>
                  that the m<del>s</del>an who, as it chanced, had been sitting beside me, had<lb/>
                  gone off with 2,000 schillings taken out of the pocket of a<lb/>
                  jacket hanging on the bedroom door, I could not know that this<lb/>
                  was not a mere incident but almost a matter of routine.  When,<lb/>
                  ultimately, he took with him to Athens 80,000 sch. in cash<lb/>
                  (proceeds of the sale of a building plot) and lost it all on the<lb/>
                  way, this mishap was almost a foregone conclusion.<lb/>
                  That the sexual relationship between Auden and Kallman<lb/>
                  ceased as far back as 19<del>5</del>41 is well known:  from that time on -<lb/>
                  there is evidence in the poetry - sex and love became, for Auden,<lb/>
                  t<del>o</del>wo separate matters.  He felt married to Chester (when he was<lb/>
                  not Mother) for the rest of his life, and he wrote that Chester<lb/>
                  was the only person who, emotionally and intellectually, was<lb/>
                  wholly indispensable to him.<lb/>
                  Like it or not, this statement has to be accepted with all<lb/>
                  the weight it carries.  It was never possible, even in the<lb/>
                  Austrian era, to keep Chester in purdah for long, and when ther<unclear>e</unclear><lb/>
                  was a visitor from Athens at Hinterholz 6 there could be tensio<del><unclear></unclear></del>n.<lb/>
                  Auden gave orders to Yannis Boras in the abrupt tones of a<lb/>
                  colonial Englishman of yore speaking to the "boy", and when I<lb/>
                  asked one day at lu<del><unclear>c</unclear></del>nch: "Where is, er....?" he said with a

                  smirk of satisfaction: "I sent him up on to the roof to mend tiles."<lb/>
                  But fundamentally nothing had changed between them:  this explains<lb/>
                  <del>his</del>Auden´s intense anxiety over the death of Boras in a car accident in<lb/>
                  Lower Austria, and his fear communicated itself to me as I searched<lb/>
                  for Chester in Vienna.  It was nearly Christmas, what on earth<lb/>
                  would become of him, distraught and alone?  (He had in fact not<lb/>
                  go<del>en</del>ne to Austria after all, but had not let Auden know.) There<lb/>
                  followed the gloomy summer <del>l</del>of 1969 when Chester was sunk in deep<lb/>
                  depression while Wy&#x15B;tan had a full work programme, and when he<lb/>
                  told me he could hardly think how Chester would get through the<lb/>
                  summer1this was indeed Mother speaking.<lb/>
                  What was it in Chester Kallman that made him so entirely<lb/>
                  indispensable to Auden?  Perhaps the question is impossible to<lb/>
                  answer;  some may hold it to be inadmissible, or attempts to find<lb/>
                  points of reference impertinent.  Others again may find the whole<lb/>
                  subject unappetising.  But to anyone with an interest in psycholog<unclear>y</unclear><lb/>
                  in the processes of cre<del>w</del><unclear>a</unclear>tivity in general and in those of Auden<lb/>
                  in particular, there is no way of getting round this essential<lb/>
                  relationship.  It may, after all, come to be seen as one of the<lb/>
                  most curious in the history of English literature.<lb/>
                  In their love of music, of opera above all, Kallma<del>n</del>nwas in<lb/>
                  the lead.  He was a minor poet who wrote because he needed to do s<unclear></unclear><lb/>
                  but his output was slight.  Yet in many spheres which were of<lb/>
                  intense interest to Auden he had little, sometimes nothing to offe<unclear>r:</unclear><lb/>
                  German literature (though Chester picked <del>i</del>up languages with uncomm<unclear>o</unclear>n<lb/>
                  facility; Wystan´s <del>G</del> spoken German was execrable but his compre-<lb/>
                  hension unerring), the history of cultures, religion and liturgy,<lb/>
                  translation.  When I was with them Wystan did not only most of the<lb/>
                  talking, but of the asking as well; his great charm lay in his<lb/>
                  alert interest in other people´s work, and he would draw one out<lb/>
                  on the odder backwaters of Austrian history.  This side of him com<unclear>e</unclear>s<lb/>

                  afternoon, Kallman was silent.  Kallman lacked Auden´s sensitivit<unclear>y</unclear><lb/>

                  lost his roots in Europe.<lb/>
                  On his own ground, operatic libretti, Chester Kallman was<lb/>
                  still in good running order, and when the Rake´s Progress was put<lb/>
                  on in Vienna he wrote a letter to Die Presse protesting sharply<lb/>
                  <del>over</del>against the cuts <del>which had been</del> made by the producer.  But of that<lb/>
                  conversational brilliance which old friends have described there<lb/>
                  was little sign.  A scene comes to mind: Auden was away, and Chester<lb/>
                  asked me to meet him for lunch at a restaurant off the Kärntner-<lb/>
                  strasse.  A young man whose background clearly lay somewhere<lb/>
                  within the crime belt near the Prater was with him, and soon the<lb/>
                  youth <del><unclear></unclear></del>sand I were engrossed in conversation, while Chester, feeling<lb/>
                  out of it, sulked.  Immediately after coffee it seemed best to<lb/>
                  leave them.  Chester´s intelligence and wit had not deserted him<lb/>
                  but they had too little scope, and, perhaps owing to his carp-like<lb/>
                  appearance, he was liable to be underestimated.  He was good-natured,<lb/>
                  in course of time even affectionate, hospitable and amusing.  He<lb/>
                  looked after Auden devotedly and we know that he was able to banish<lb/>
                  Auden´s loneliness as no one else could.  His misfortune was that<lb/>
                  he lacked those qualities which Auden possessed and which decide<lb/>
                  between success and failure.<lb/>
                  It cannot, all the same, have been easy living on a long-term<lb/>
                  basis with Auden in New Yo<del>r</del>wk while attempting, even though<lb/>
                  fitfully, to develop his own personality and talents.  Putting up with Auden´s<lb/>
                  fads, his insistence on punctuality and the rigid routine was one<lb/>
                  thing;  to grow up, to mature in the shadow of this oversized tree<lb/>
                  was another.  There was not enough light.  So he fled, but without<lb/>
                  Mother there was no way he could live at all.<lb/>
                  It is essentia<del>sl</del>l, in the light of what happened later on, to<lb/>
                  remember Auden´s generosity.  His biographer mentioned the two boys<lb/>
                  whose further education was financed by Auden:  I can confirm this<lb/>
                  as we lived next door to them for a few years.  They were the sons of<lb/>
                  an artist;  both made rapid careers in industrial management.  But<lb/>
                  there were other examples.  Wyst<del>s</del><unclear>a</unclear>n had telephoned and asked me to<lb/>
                  meet him and Chester at the Operncafé - the much-missed café-<lb/>
                  restaurant next to the Opera, now a car salesroom.  They were waiting<lb/>
                  for Balanchine to join them after the performance, but we waited in<lb/>
                  vain and fi<del>kn</del><unclear>na</unclear>lly gave up and went home.  There was a fourth at our<lb/>
                  table, a silent young man who, Chester said in an undertone, was<lb/>
                  a student of technology and Wyst<del>sa</del><unclear>an</unclear> was helping with his studies.

               <p>
                  Dear Stella, Got back from Oxford yesterday and found your<lb/>
                  letter waiting.  1) I think I ought to take the couple in,<lb/>
                  but I m<del>k</del>ust leave it to you to decide whether they are O.K.<lb/>
                  If they are, all rooms, including my study (which can´t be<lb/>
                  heated) are open to them.  2)  How m<del>k<unclear>u</unclear></del>uch money will they need<lb/>
                  to keep going?  And how shall I make the arrangements for<lb/>
                  payment.  3) Will they be able to find work or emigrate<lb/>
                  before I return in April, when I´m afraid there will not<lb/>
                  be room for them?  4) I´m worried about how they will get<lb/>
                  gas cylinders for cooking from Neulengbach, since, presumably,<lb/>
                  they have no car.  I expect someone in the village will help.<lb/>
                  5)  If and when they come, I must know in advance so that I<lb/>
                  can write a note to the Burgom<del><unclear>a</unclear></del>eister..." (sic).

                  here because it is so characteristic;  the follow-up is even<lb/>

                  Many thanks for your letter.  Of course,<lb/>
                  selfishly, I´m rather relieved.  How horrid<lb/>
                  one is!<lb/>

                  Great generosity (these facts, even separately, are known<lb/>
                  to no more than two or three people) <del>ed  existed</del>combined in Auden´s<lb/>
                  character quite readily with his legendary stinginess in the<lb/>
                  small things of everyday life such as stamps or cigarettes.<lb/>
                  "Life" magazine, he told me one day with a beaming smile, had<lb/>
                  just paid him 5,000 dolla<del>sr</del><unclear>r</unclear>s for an article.  "I´m thinking<lb/>
                  of building on a diningroom."  "Very good idea" I said,<lb/>
                  "but for a start I shall smoke your cigarettes for the rest of<lb/>
                  the afternoon."  I very much doubt whether I did.  On the other<lb/>
                  hand he would order things to be sent out from Vienna <del>a</del>without<lb/>
                  a second thought.  After his car accident he sent me a message<lb/>
                  and I drove out to Kirchstetten.  He was dishevelled and cross.<lb/>
                  It´s a curious thing, he said, but the first chap <del>you see</del> who<lb/>

                  When the friendly voice on the end of the line had repeated<lb/>
                  the order I<del>ö</del>asked when they would be making their next delivery<lb/>
                  in the area around Kirchstetten.  "Oh but we never deliver out<lb/>
                  there" said the voice, "We make a special trip for the Herr<lb/>
                  Professor."  Startled, I exclaimed "For goodness´ sake, that must<lb/>
                  cost him a packet - you can buy that brand of gin in Böheimkirchen!"<lb/>
                  "Certainly you can" said the voice which now sounded amused,<lb/>
                  "but why do we have to worry our heads over the way a Herr<lb/>
                  Profess<del>s</del><unclear>o</unclear>r flings his money around?"  I liked the "we".<lb/>
                  What was so American about the kitchen?1<lb/>
                  When fitted kitchens first came in the Austrians calle<del>s</del>d<unclear>d</unclear><lb/>
                  them "American" - the term is now as ex<del>d</del>tinct as "Russian" tea<lb/>
                  but m<del>u</del>kst still have been common parlance in Kirchstetten.<lb/>
                  There was a tidy line-up consisting of fridge, sink, low<lb/>
                  cupboards providing a good working surface,,a corner <del>f</del>cupboard<lb/>
                  the interior of which s<del><unclear>x</unclear></del>wung out, and a gas stove.  Both men were<lb/>
                  very proud of the kitchen and it became Chester´s habitat.<lb/>
                  But the whole point of a modern kitchen:  the labour-saving<lb/>
                  working area, ample storage space, accessibility, was totally<lb/>
                  cancelled out by the permanent clutter.  It was a matter of<lb/>
                  principle with Chester to have all cooking ingredients con<del>c</del>veniently<lb/>
                  to hand, which meant that nothing was ever put away, and where<lb/>
                  his loving eye saw method, even the least fussy visitor could<lb/>
                  only see a shambles.  But an interesting shambles owing to the<lb/>
                  exotic nature of the preserved foods and spices which Chester<lb/>
                  brought with him.  There was <del>a</del> for example a dried leaf which,<lb/>
                  detected by me in a casserole, was said to have no flavour but<lb/>
                  to serve as a stimulus or bridge to other flavours.<lb/>
                  It was clear from the beginning that the two of them were<lb/>
                  not so much drinking as eating their way into their graves <del>i</del>owing

                  Whether or not - and Chester was convinced that this was so -<lb/>
                  the business about alleged arrears of income tax shortened Auden´s<lb/>
                  life must be left open.  The "Declaration" to the tax authorities<lb/>
                  in which a great poet patiently explains how poetry comes to be<lb/>
                  written must be unique and deserves a place in the history of<lb/>
                  literature.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Declaration. 1<lb/>
                  Gentlemen,<lb/>
                  My position is very simple: one pays income tax where one<lb/>
                  earns money, that is to say in my case, as a writer writing in<lb/>
                  English, in the United States and in England.  In Austria I<lb/>
                  earn not one groschen, I merely spend sch<del>i</del>ullings.<lb/>
                  You maintain that I possess a "material interest" in Austria,<lb/>
                  by which you presumably mean a "financial" interest.  That might<lb/>
                  conceivably be the case if I had to say to myself:  "I must go<lb/>
                  to Austria because I can only work in Austria!"  But that is not<lb/>
                  the case.  I have lived in many places in many different countries<lb/>
                  and was always able <del>e</del>to work wherever I might be.<lb/>
                  I naturally have a "p<del>ö<unclear>e</unclear></del><unclear>er</unclear>sonal" interest in Austria, otherwise<lb/>
                  I should not come here.  The landscape is pleasing, and I find<lb/>
                  the Austrians whose acquaintance I have made, friendly an<unclear>sd</unclear><lb/>
                  charming.<lb/>
                  You say correctly that I once received <del><unclear>n</unclear></del>an Austrian prize<lb/>
                  for lieterature.  This was a great honour of which I am very<lb/>
                  proud.  You cannot however serioiusly believe, Gentlemen, that I<lb/>
                  calculated:  "If I continue to go to Austria maybe I shall be<lb/>
                  given a prize"?  Until it was awarded to me I had never heard<lb/>
                  of <del>the</del>this prize.  It is equally clear that I cannot receive it a

                  second time.  You also go on to say that a road in Kirchstetten<lb/>
                  has been named Audenstraße after me.  That was a very kind gesture<lb/>
                  on the part of the local council, but it cannot be maintaine<del>d</del>sd<lb/>
                  that I profit from it <del>i</del>financially.<lb/>
                  Further, you say with truth that I have written several poems<lb/>
                  <del>in A</del> <del>with</del>o<del><unclear>j</unclear></del>n Austrian themes.  To this I would like to make three<lb/>
                  statements.<lb/>
                  1.  I have never, in Austria, received so much as one<lb/>
                  penny for my poems.  One or two of them have been trans-<lb/>
                  lated into German, but in these cases the translators have<lb/>
                  received the money, not I.<lb/>
                  2.  I believe you are not clearly aware how poetry comes<lb/>
                  to be written.  What is generally taken to be the subject<lb/>
                  matter is only a viewpoint, an occasion whereby certain<lb/>
                  thoughts about nature, God, history, mankind etc. may be<lb/>
                  expressed which the poet may have had in mind for a very<lb/>
                  long time.  I wrote, for example, a poem to commemorate the<lb/>
                  20th anniversary of the death of Josef Weinheber.<lb/>
                  Fundamentally however the poem is concerned with quite<lb/>
                  different things.  First of all it is about the love<lb/>
                  which every poet, whatever his nationality, has for his<lb/>
                  mother tongue, and secondly about what happened after the<lb/>
                  war in the countries which were defeated, i.e. not only<lb/>
                  in Austria but in Germany and Italy.  Again:  in 1964<lb/>
                  I wrote a poem with the title "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten"<lb/>
                  because it was where I happ<del>p</del>ened to be.  But the place is<lb/>
                  unimportant.  In real<del>t</del>ity the question in this poem is<lb/>
                  what, for a Christian, is the meaning of the Feast of<lb/>
                  Pentecost.  And this is valid for all countries in the<lb/>
                  same way.<lb/>
                  3.  I believe you do not clearly recognize a poet´s (Dichte<unclear>r</unclear>)<lb/>
                  financial s<del>k</del>ituation.  If he is suc<del>e</del><unclear>c</unclear>essful, a novelist<lb/>
                  can ma<del>,</del>ke a good deal of money.  A poet (Lyriker) cannot,<lb/>
                  even if he is very well known, because he is only read<lb/>
                  by a minority.  By far the greater part of my income<lb/>
                  comes not from the sale of my volumes of poetry but from<lb/>
                  book reviews, translations, lectures etc., activities<lb/>
                  which have nothing to do with Austria.  A<del>m</del><unclear>n</unclear>d while we are

               <p>
                  on the subject of translation<del><unclear>:</unclear></del>s  you rightly say that<lb/>
                  I have a great int<del>r</del>erest in German and Austrian literatu<unclear></unclear><lb/>
                  I may add in music as well - but I do not have to come<lb/>
                  to Austria in order to read or to hear them.<lb/>
                  You see f<del>er<unclear>o</unclear></del><unclear>rom</unclear> all <del>the above</del> this that the arguments brought<lb/>
                  forward by you for subjecting me to payment of income tax are not<lb/>
                  valid.  The most pertinent argument against it is that in the<lb/>
                  course of one year I always stay under six months in Austri<del>sa</del><unclear>aa</unclear><lb/>
                  and never spend more than three months here consecutively.<lb/>
                  A word in conclusion: if this in my view entirely unjustifiable<lb/>
                  nonsense does not cease, I shall leave Austria never to return,<lb/>
                  which would be very sad for me and perhaps too for the shopkeepers<lb/>
                  <del>i</del>of Kirchstetten.  One thing, Gentlemen, I cannot conceal from you:<lb/>
                  if this should happen it m<del>i</del>kght give rise to a scandal of worldwide<lb/>
                  dimensions.<lb/>

                  1 You ask why I have made over my half of our property in<lb/>
                  Kirchstetten to Mr Chester Kallman who is not related to me.<lb/>
                  Mr Kallman is my heir.  I have no children and for years past<lb/>
                  he has been my literary collaborator.  <del>s</del>Jointly, we have written<lb/>
                  five new opera libretti, "The Rake´s Progress, "Elegy for Young<lb/>
                  Lovers", "The Bassarids_" and "Love´s Labours Lost".  And<lb/>
                  together we have made new translations of "The MagiccFlute",<lb/>
                  "Don Giovanni", "Die Sieben Todsünden", "Mahagonny" and<lb/>
                  "Archifanfaro".  I am now 65 years old and must reckon with all<lb/>
                  eventualities such as a heart attack.  As you know better than<lb/>
                  I, in the event of sudden death great difficulties arise for the<lb/>
                  heirs to landed property, particularly in a foreign country.

                  "Every day f<del>p</del>or the past year" said Chester "I have stood<lb/>
                  outside his door in the early morning, afraid to go in."<lb/>
                  This was later.  Now, Auden was dead, the voice issuing<lb/>
                  from the car radio had just said so.  A few days ago we had<lb/>
                  talked about his reading in the Society for Literature on 28<lb/>
                  September.  Unfortunately, I said, I was obliged to drive to<lb/>
                  Linz and to spend the n<del>i</del>kght there, but they were welcome to use<lb/>
                  my Vienna flat.  It was maddening and I would just as soon<lb/>
                  put it off.  No, said Auden, mustn´t do that, one should stick<lb/>
                  to one´s commitments.  "And you won´t be missing much" he<lb/>
                  reassured me, "you´ve heard it all before."  We would meet again<lb/>
                  in a few days´time and then he would tell me all about it.  He was<lb/>
                  not sure about the fla<del>as</del>t but he would let me know in good time.<lb/>
                  On 24 September he wrote a note to say that he did not need the<lb/>
                  flat, he would go to the Hotel Altenburgerhof.  The handwriting<lb/>
                  is ragged.<lb/>
                  Linz already lay far behind, the car radio went on m<del>k</del>uttering<lb/>
                  to itself unheeded until the familiar voice of Friedrich Hee<del>ee</del>r<del><unclear></unclear></del>r<unclear></unclear><lb/>
                  came through, reading one of his book reviews.  It was consoling<lb/>
                  in a world where, suddenly, a signpost was missing.  W<del>j</del>hat are<lb/>
                  you howling about, I asked myself, what gives you the right to<lb/>
                  mourn for Wystan?  Think of Chester.  It was impossible not to<lb/>
                  think of Chester:  it was not so much a question how much he<lb/>
                  would grieve over the death of Wystan, as how he would survive<lb/>
                  at all.  Leaving the autobahn at St.Pölten I drove straight to<lb/>
                  Kirchstetten;  it seemed to be just possible that he might have<lb/>
                  arrived in the meantime.  But the green shutters were closed<lb/>
                  and there was no one about apart from the wall-eyed dog, an<lb/>
                  exceptionally hideous mongrel belonging to Frau Strobl, which<lb/>
                  barked in an irritating falsetto.  He barked from a position close<lb/>
                  beside me while I wrote a note and stuck it in the chink between<lb/>
                  the door´s shutters, and he was still barking as I shut the<lb/>
                  garden gate behind me.<lb/>
                  The answer to my note was a telephone call from Frau Strobl:<lb/>
                  Herr Kallman said, would I come over to tea the next day?<lb/>
                  That was the Sunday.

                  The sittingroom seemed to be full of people.  <del>-</del>Chester was<lb/>
                  sitting on the corner-seat facing the door, where Auden always<lb/>
                  used to sit, every <del>seat</del>chair appeared to be occupied and two young<lb/>
                  men were sitting <del>in the back</del> on the floor.  Chester hurried<lb/>
                  across the room, hugged me and said "The whole thing´s terrible,<lb/>

                  I was introduced to the others.  Mrs. Thekla Clark and her<lb/>

                  <del>in Kirchstetten, the mayor Herr Enzinger</del> Herr Enzinger the mayor<lb/>
                  of Kirchstetten, <del>a</del>the film scriptwriter Adolf Opel, and the young men.<lb/>
                  Clearly, the meeting to discuss the funeral arra<del>n</del>ggements was<lb/>
                  not proceeding smoothly.  The mayor looked annoyed, Frau Seitz<lb/>
                  looked worried and Mrs Clark bewildered.  There were, of course,<lb/>
                  language difficulties.  Mayor Enzinger spoke not a word of<lb/>
                  <del><unclear>G</unclear></del>English and the Clarks no German, while the headmistress had a<lb/>
                  certain command of English but did not feel up to acting as<lb/>
                  interpreter and adviser in one;  Chester´a German was perfect<del>k</del><unclear>l</unclear>y<lb/>
                  adequate.<lb/>
                  The root of the problem lay on a deeper level, where two<lb/>
                  separate cultures collided head on.  Chester was barely coherent,<lb/>
                  but he managed to explain his point of view.  He loathed, from<lb/>
                  the bottom of his hearteverything in the way of pompes funèbres.<lb/>
                  He wanted to bury Aud<del>s</del><unclear>e</unclear>n, he said, quietly and privately and, if<lb/>
                  it could possibly be managed, on Tuesday.  He had already informed<lb/>
                  Wyst<del>s</del>an´s brother Dr. John Auden, Stephen Spender and <del>os</del>others<lb/>
                  of the arran<del>t</del>gements and asked them to arrive, if not tomorrow,<lb/>
                  then on Tuesday morning at the latest.  On the other hand the<lb/>
                  mayor of Kirchstetten, he went on, wanted to lay on a really big<lb/>
                  show with brass bands and all the rest of it, and what was more<lb/>
                  on the Saturday to give as many people as possible the chance to<lb/>
                  come.  The Ministry of Education and the provincial council of<lb/>
                  Lower Austria were to be represented, and as the last straw the<lb/>
                  hearse was to drive <del>i</del>up to the house.  He would not allow any of<lb/>
                  this, he said:  "I can´t bear it and I won´t have it."<lb/>
                  Mayor Enzinger drew a deep breath.  The first thing we had<lb/>
                  to realise, he pointed out, was that the body had not yet been

                  released by the authorities.  In all cases where the cause of death<lb/>
                  is not wholly clear certain<unclear>k</unclear>formalities are obligatory, and even<lb/>
                  intervention at a high level would not work miracles.  Everything<lb/>
                  takes time.  And how could anyone expect it of him, the Bürgermeister<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
                  that he should refrain from notifying the Ministry and the Cultural<lb/>
                  department of the Council of the <del>d</del>eeath of Professor _Auden?  It<lb/>
                  was as much as his job was wor<unclear>t</unclear>h.  Now Frau Seitz spoke.  The<lb/>
                  inhabitants of Kirchstetten, she believed, would hardly bury a dog<lb/>
                  in the manner proposed by Herr Kallman, let alone a great poet.<lb/>
                  Chester Kallman´s position was entirely comprehensible - to<lb/>
                  some of us.  To him, an <del>E</del>American of Jewish origin and a non-believer,<lb/>
                  the whole pomp and circumstance of a traditional Austrian funeral<lb/>
                  was abhorrent.  Where prominent personages are concerned, there<lb/>
                  would certainly be the local brass band, and where appropr<unclear>i</unclear>a<unclear>te</unclear> delegations representing<lb/>
                  the voluntary fire brigade, the federal railways, the veterans´<lb/>
                  association and others besides, and the gamekeepers would blow<lb/>
                  their horns and wish him good hunting in the Elysian fields.<lb/>
                  To Chester´s mind such folksy rituals were as foreign as the burial<lb/>
                  rites of the Incas.  He did not know that not very long ago in<lb/>
                  Lower Austria, Auden as a bachelor would have been accompanied in<lb/>
                  the funeral procession by a "bride" dressed in white.  He was<lb/>
                  unable to understand that his intentions were an intolerable affront<lb/>
                  to the population of Kirchstetten.  In his despair, it certainly<lb/>
                  never occurred to him that Auden himself would very likely have<lb/>
                  been entranced at the idea of a slap-up funeral with all the<lb/>
                  trimmings - one can almost hear his Olympian laughter - followed<lb/>
                  by a hearty meal at the inn where he had so often <del>had</del>ate his l<del>i</del>unch.<lb/>
                  As it turned out, Chester got no marks in local opinion for this<lb/>
                  finale either, as the meal consisted of Leberkäs with vegetables:<lb/>
                  <unclear>T</unclear>his consisted of fried slices off a loaf of a flabby substance which is neither liver nor cheese related to the<lb/>
                  Frankfurter sausage.  It is a<lb/>
                  homely, juicy meal all too familiar to every Austrian;  a<del>b</del>nd it is<lb/>
                  cheap.<del>n</del> There would be <del>mkuc</del> much talk of this also after all was ove<unclear>r</unclear><lb/>
                  For their part, the local people were forgetting that Chester was<lb/>
                  probably in financial straits - not that this would have been taken<lb/>
                  as an excuse.<lb/>
                  For a moment the discussion had come to a standstill.<lb/>

                  fetched more beer, Frau Strobl walked in and out and rolled a<lb/>
                  baleful eye on us as she spoke into Chester´s ear.<lb/>
                  The points at issue were not only When and How Much;  there<lb/>
                  was also the matter of the church service and the prayers at the<lb/>
                  graveside.  Many people in Akustria had assumed Auden to be of the<lb/>
                  Roman Catholic faith;  he had of course remained <del>-</del>a:<del>s</del>member of the<lb/>
                  Anglican and Episcopalian churche<del><unclear>e</unclear></del>s.  The misunderstanding arose<lb/>
                  from his regular attendance at mass in the parish church and his<lb/>
                  friendly relationship with Father Lustkandl, the parish priest<lb/>
                  referred to in "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten".  Auden asked<lb/>
                  Lustkandl´s sucessor for permission to be buried in the churchyard,<lb/>
                  and his wish was accede<del>o</del><unclear>d</unclear> to.   Evid<del>n</del>ently<unclear>,</unclear> <del>T</del>the next <unclear>l</unclear>ogical thing to do, then,<lb/>
                  was to approach the chaplain to the British Embassy in Vienna,´<lb/>
                  the Revd. Bruce Duncan, and ask him to officiate.  What form of<lb/>
                  service this should be - there could be no question of a funeral<lb/>
                  mass - left everyone present at a loss.  We agreed at last that<lb/>
                  it ought to be some kind of ecumenical ceremony held jointly by<lb/>
                  the two clergymen, but that first of all, the plan must be put<lb/>
                  before D<del>D</del>r John Auden.<lb/>
                  At this juncture Chester Kallman withdrew his insistence on<lb/>
                  <del>an all too early funeral.</del>  the impossibly early date for the<lb/>
                  funeral.  The room had become much too warm, the oxygen was<lb/>
                  running out and Chester would not be able to stand much more<lb/>
                  pressure.  The most urgent <del>step</del> objective waslquite simply to<lb/>
                  free him from our burdensome presence.  Once everyone had agreed<lb/>
                  that Auden´s relations must be told immediately that the funeral<lb/>
                  <del>ah</del>had been postponed, the moment had come to dissolve the meeting.<lb/>
                  Mrs Clark undertook to telephone to London and Frau Strobl would<lb/>
                  drive her to the Post Office.  Chester asked me to talk everything<lb/>
                  over with Frau Seitz and Herr Enzinger and reach definite concl<del>i</del>u-<lb/>
                  sions.  We all stood up, Chester came across the room to me and<lb/>
                  spoke in an undertone.  He was completely exhausted, he said,<lb/>
                  he couldn´t stand much more.  "I´ll do anything you want, you<lb/>
                  must just try to hold the others in check." Finally he said<lb/>
                  "It´ll be all right, I´m crammed full of tranquillizers, all I<lb/>
                  need is a bit of a rest."  He embraced me warmly and left the room.

                  the chief mourners.  It was "he-whose-name-we-never-mention";<lb/>
                  or if it was, Chester had said, Auden crossed himself.<lb/>
                  At the lowest point in Kirchstetten where the roads divide<lb/>
                  thr procession halted while the coffin was transferred from the<lb/>
                  hearse to a hand-drawn bier.  At this point the Church took charge<lb/>
                  and the procession resumed its steady pace;  photographs exist<lb/>
                  which were taken during the brief interval.<lb/>
                  To British ears quite unremarkable, the ecumenic<del>la</del>al service<lb/>
                  was much ta<del>o</del>Iked about in A<del>ku</del>ustrian circles because nothing of the<lb/>
                  kind had been known <del>n</del>before.  The Revd. Bruce Du<del><unclear>o</unclear></del>ncan, today Rector<lb/>
                  of Crediton in Devon, can remember little <del>more</del> about the general<lb/>
                  circumstances but confirms that he used the Book of Common Prayer<lb/>
                  and the long reading from the first <del>book</del>Letter of St.Paul to the<lb/>
                  Corin<del>g</del>thians, chapter 15, verses 20-58. Beyond that, all he recalls<lb/>
                  <del>is the hysterical behaviour </del> is his difficulties with Chester.<lb/>
                  Reaching for my Authorised Version, for surely no one would<lb/>
                  have dared to use any other, on second thoughts I also took out the<lb/>
                  New Testament as translated into German by Martin Luther.  After<lb/>
                  reading the English text through ve<del>d</del>ry slowly, and then a second<lb/>
                  time, I did the same with the Luther<del>n</del>an Bible and lost in thought<lb/>
                  compared the two, verse by verse.<lb/>
                  "How nice to see you" said Auden who was sitting on one of the<lb/>
                  white garden chairs with the red covers, "it´s a bit einsam here.<lb/>
                  And I wanted to write and tell you that the technical word for<lb/>
                  buddle is Erzwaschtrog.  I hope there is an equivalent German<lb/>
                  euphemism for `senior citizen´.  Oh and adit is stollen, and although<lb/>
                  I may be wrong, I guess concentrating mill is Vereinigungsmühle."<lb/>
                  "What a mercy you´ve told me" I said, relieved.  "I should have<lb/>
                  to have dug up such frightful words in the British Council library.<lb/>
                  But do you think people will understand all that about the primary<lb/>
                  and secondary worlds, or will they get muddled?"<lb/>
                  "It´s perfectly simple" said Auden.  "The initial impulse to<lb/>
                  create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by encounters,<lb/>
                  in the primary world, with sacred beings or events."<lb/>
                  "There is one glory of the sun" I heard myself say, "and<lb/>
                  another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars:  for on

                  star differeth from another in glory."<lb/>
                  "Ah" he said, "you´ve been reading Corinthians One, chapter 15.<lb/>
                  `Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.´ Chester and I took<lb/>
                  that bidding rather too literally."<lb/>
                  "Who would know where that familiar quotation comes from?"<lb/>
                  I wondered.<lb/>
                  "I would" said Auden.  "I´ve been looking up the German text.<lb/>
                  Have you ever compared the Autho<del>s</del>rized Version with Martin Luther?"<lb/>
                  "Funny you should ask that" I said.  "It´s one of the things<lb/>
                  I forgot to talk to you about.  `Be not deceived:  evil<del>,</del>comm<del>k<unclear>u</unclear></del>unica-<lb/>
                  tions corrupt good manners.´ He renders that as <unclear>`L</unclear>asset euch nicht<lb/>
                  verführen!  Böse Geschwätze verderben gute Sitten.´"<lb/>
                  "Very neat" said Auden happily.  I like `evil chatter´<lb/>
                  better than `comm<del>k</del>unications´."<lb/>
                  "The publishers" Isaid "have a rather heavy-handed way of<lb/>
                  printing the more quotable bits in bold-face.  But in the next<lb/>
                  verse Luther seems to flounder.  `Werdet doch einmal recht nüchtern<lb/>
                  und sündiget nicht!<unclear>´"</unclear> Do be a bit sober for once, he pleads.  And<lb/>
                  sin not.  King James´s translators fancied that St Paul cried out<lb/>
                  <del><del>S</del>s</del>`Awake to righteousness!"<lb/>
                  "Who knows what he really said."<lb/>
                  "Luther´s language is very fine as he reaches the clim<del>x</del>ax:<lb/>
                  `Siehe, ich sage euch ein Geheimnis... ´"<lb/>
                  But Auden was speaking.  "Behold, I shew you a mystery:<lb/>
                  we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment,<lb/>
                  in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:  for the trumpet<lb/>
                  shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we<lb/>
                  shall be changed.´"  And with that he vanished.  Now wide awake, I<lb/>
                  put the two books back on their shelf and settled down to re-type<lb/>
                  Auden´s speech at Neulengbach.<lb/>
                  Sehr verehrter Herr Landeshauptmann, Ladies and gentlemen:<lb/>
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally.  I do so,<lb/>
