                  <hi rend="underline">In Retrospect.</hi><lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Since then the Auden industry has not been idle. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>An<lb/>
                  excellent biography was published1 and <del>k</del>in this the Austrian<lb/>
                  period was dealt with but not locally researched. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Edward<lb/>
                  Mendelson edited Auden´s early works and wrote superb commentaries.<lb/>
                  There has been a biography of Chester Kallman. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Writers of PhD<lb/>
                  theses have been out here and have shaken us up, particularly<lb/>
                  Michael O´Sullivan of Trinity College, Dublin who - not speaking<lb/>
                  a word of German - organised a full-scale exhibition and an<lb/>
                  international symposium in Vienna. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The editor of this volume<lb/>
                  Peter Müller had brought Michael out to see me at Fri<del>e</del>dau in the<lb/>
                  preceding year; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>now he came again, and after the closure,<lb/>
                  exhausted, he spent a long weekend in the country to recover.<lb/>
                  We dug out ancient files containing original Auden manuscripts,<lb/>
                  letters, personal notes and newspaper cuttings, and now we tried<lb/>
                  to winnow the wheat from the chaff. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>After some general discussion<lb/>
                  it seemed to us all that there remain certain aspects of Auden´s<lb/>
                  life in Lower Austria which are not on record, or where they are,<lb/>
                  not from the worm´s eye view. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>As an older man he was happier<lb/>
                  here than anywhere else: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>he felt at home. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He was at Kirchstette<unclear>n</unclear><lb/>
                  not only during the summer, <del>i</del>as is often said, but with<lb/>
                  interruptions for five months, depending on his engagements.<lb/>
                  In the course of these years he was still highly <del>productive</del><lb/>
                  creative. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So that it might, we thought, be of value to put some<lb/>
                  of those things on record which would otherwise be lost. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Not<lb/>
                  for the first time self<del>.</del>-criticism was expressed, but while doubts<lb/>
                  concerning self-importance<del><unclear>s</unclear></del>and sell-out of f<del>i</del>riendship were not<lb/>
                  entirely banished, the view prevailed that the local witness<lb/>
                  needs to be put on paper. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Scholarship is at work elsewhere;<lb/>
                  here a few appendices and footnotes are on offer.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Auden´s opinions on biographies of creative artists in general<lb/>
                  were, as Humphrey Carpenter pointed out, highly contradictory.<lb/>
                  Again and again he said that the private life of poets and other<lb/>
                  people engaged in creative work is none of the public´s business<lb/>
                  but he also said<unclear>:</unclear>´`The biography of an artist, if his life as a w<unclear>hole</unclear><lb/>
                  was sufficiently interesting, is permissible, provided that the<lb/>
                  biographer and his readers realise that such an account throws no<lb/>
                  light whatsoever upon the artist´s work." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And "I do believe,<lb/>
                  however, that, more often than most people realise, <del>k</del>his works<lb/>
                  may throw light upon his life."

                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>Carpenter´s book calls itself "a first biography", and the<lb/>
                  author expressly restricts his aims: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"It is not a work of literary<lb/>
                  criticism". <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It may also be felt to lack an analysis of some<lb/>
                  fundamental questions: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>about the depths of the poet´s personality,<lb/>
                  his "otherness" (to confine this to his homosexuality would be to<lb/>
                  oversimplify) and the basis of his all-important relationship<lb/>
                  with Chester Kallman. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>As a star<del>it</del>ting point, "Early Auden"1 which<lb/>
                  presents an<del>s</del>d comments on the poetry, drama and prose up to 1939<lb/>
                  is most valuable, and Edward Mendelson will produce further works<lb/>
                  of scholarship.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>What would Wystan Auden say if he could read "Auden in Love"<lb/>
                  by Chester´s old coll<del>a</del>ege friend and last-minute stepmother Dorothy<lb/>
                  J. Farnon?2 <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In July 1985 the Sunday Times published a list of<lb/>
                  recommended holiday <del>books</del> reading. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The assessment of "Auden in<lb/>
                  Love" was a model of compression: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"emetic but compulsive".<lb/>
                  I more than once came up against Auden´s idée fixe about the<lb/>
                  irrelevance of the poet´s private self, and asked him one day:<lb/>
                  "So no rotting apples in the desk drawer?" <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"No, no rotting apples<lb/>
                  "And if you have an attack of the trots and interrupt your work?"<lb/>
                  "That would make no difference at all." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Chester´s sole explanatio<gap reason="illegible"/><lb/>
                  was that it was "a tick like any other", and that in any case he<lb/>

                  (proceeds of the sale of a building plot) and lost it all on the<lb/>

                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>On his own ground, operatic libretti, Chester Kallman was<lb/>
                  still in good running order, and when the Rake´s Progress was put<lb/>
                  on in Vienna he wrote a letter to Die Presse protesting sharply<lb/>

                  conversational brilliance which old friends have described there<lb/>
                  was little sign. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>A scene comes to mind: Auden was away, and Chester<lb/>
                  asked me to meet him for lunch at a restaurant off the Kärntner-<lb/>
                  strasse. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>A young man whose background clearly lay somewhere<lb/>
                  within the crime belt near the Prater was with him, and soon the<lb/>
                  youth <unclear>s</unclear>and I were engrossed in conversation, while Chester, feeling<lb/>
                  out of it, sulked. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Immediately after coffee it seemed best to<lb/>
                  leave them. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Chester´s intelligence and wit had not deserted him<lb/>
                  but they had too little scope, and, perhaps owing to his carp-like<lb/>
                  appearance, he was liable to be underestimated. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He was good-natured,<lb/>
                  in course of time even affectionate, hospitable and amusing. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He<lb/>
                  looked after Auden devotedly and we know that he was able to banish<lb/>
                  Auden´s loneliness as no one else could. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>His misfortune was that<lb/>
                  he lacked those qualities which Auden possessed and which decide<lb/>
                  between success and failure.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>It cannot, all the same, have been easy living on a long-term<lb/>
                  basis with Auden in New Yo<del>w</del>rk while attempting, even though<lb/>
                  fitfully, to develop his own personality and talents. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Putting up with Auden´s<lb/>
                  fads, his insistence on punctuality and the rigid routine was one<lb/>

                  was another. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There was not enough light. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So he fled, but without<lb/>
                  Mother there was no way he could live at all.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>It is essentia<del>sl</del>l, in the light of what happened later on, to<lb/>
                  remember Auden´s generosity. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>His biographer mentioned the two boys<lb/>
                  whose further education was financed by Auden: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I can confirm this<lb/>
                  as we lived next door to them for a few years. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>They were the sons of<lb/>
                  an artist; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>both made rapid careers in industrial management. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But<lb/>
                  there were other examples. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Wyst<del>s</del><unclear>a</unclear>n had telephoned and asked me to<lb/>

                  restaurant next to the Opera, now a car salesroom. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>They were waiting<lb/>
                  for Balanchine to join them after the performance, but we waited in<lb/>

                  up Wild on the Neuer Markt and ask them to send a few bottles out -<lb/>
                  he told me the brand name - that would be splendid.<lb/>
                  When the friendly voice on the end of the line had repeated<lb/>
                  the order I<del>ö</del>asked when they would be making their next delivery<lb/>

                  "Certainly you can" said the voice which now sounded amused,<lb/>

                  very proud of the kitchen and it became Chester´s habitat.<lb/>

                  working area, ample storage space, accessibility, was totally<lb/>
                  cancelled out by the permanent clutter. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was a matter of<lb/>
                  principle with Chester to have all cooking ingredients con<del>c</del>veniently<lb/>
                  to hand, which meant that nothing was ever put away, and where<lb/>
                  his loving eye saw method, even the least fussy visitor could<lb/>
                  only see a shambles. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But an interesting shambles owing to the<lb/>

                  Gentlemen,<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>My position is very simple: one pays income tax where one<lb/>
                  earns money, that is to say in my case, as a writer writing in<lb/>
                  English, in the United States and in England. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In Austria I<lb/>
                  earn not one groschen, I merely spend sch<del>u</del>illings.<lb/>
                  You maintain that I possess a "material interest" in Austria,<lb/>
                  by which you presumably mean a "financial" interest. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>That might<lb/>

                  and was always able <del>e</del>to work wherever I might be.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>I naturally have a "p<del>ö<unclear>e</unclear></del><unclear>e</unclear>rsonal" interest in Austria, otherwise<lb/>
                  I should not come here. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The landscape is pleasing, and I find<lb/>

                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>You say correctly that I once received <del><unclear>n</unclear></del>an Austrian prize<lb/>

                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>penny for my poems. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>One or two of them have been trans-<lb/>

                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>2. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I believe you are not clearly aware how poetry comes<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>to be written. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What is generally taken to be the subject<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>matter is only a viewpoint, an occasion whereby certain<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>thoughts about nature, God, history, mankind etc. may be<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>expressed which the poet may have had in mind for a very<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>long time. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I wrote, for example, a poem to commemorate the<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>20th anniversary of the death of Josef Weinheber.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>Fundamentally however the poem is concerned with quite<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>different things. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>First of all it is about the love<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>which every poet, whatever his nationality, has for his<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>mother tongue, and secondly about what happened after the<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>war in the countries which were defeated, i.e. not only<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>in Austria but in Germany and Italy. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Again: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>in 1964<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>I wrote a poem with the title "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten"<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>because it was where I happ<del>p</del>ened to be. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But the place is<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>unimportant. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In real<del>t</del>ity the question in this poem is<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>what, for a Christian, is the meaning of the Feast of<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>Pentecost. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And this is valid for all countries in the<lb/>

                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>3. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I believe you do not clearly recognize a poet´s (Dichter)<lb/>
                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>financial s<del>k</del>ituation. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>If he is suc<del>e</del><unclear>c</unclear>essful, a novelist<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>"Every day f<del>p</del>or the past year" said Chester "I have stood<lb/>
                  outside his door in the early morning, afraid to go in."<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>This was later. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Now, Auden was dead, the voice issuing<lb/>
                  from the car radio had just said so. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>A few days ago we had<lb/>
                  talked about his reading in the Society for Literature on 28<lb/>
                  September. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Unfortunately, I said, I was obliged to drive to<lb/>
                  Linz and to spend the n<del>k</del>ight there, but they were welcome to use<lb/>
                  my Vienna flat. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was maddening and I would just as soon<lb/>
                  put it off. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>No, said Auden, mustn´t do that, one should stick<lb/>
                  to one´s commitments. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"And you won´t be missing much" he<lb/>
                  reassured me, "you´ve heard it all before." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>We would meet again<lb/>
                  in a few days´time and then he would tell me all about it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He was<lb/>
                  not sure about the fla<del>a</del>t<del>s</del>but he would let me know in good time.<lb/>
                  On 24 September he wrote a note to say that he did not need the<lb/>
                  flat, he would go to the Hotel Altenburgerhof. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The handwriting<lb/>
                  is ragged.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Linz already lay far behind, the car radio went on m<del>k</del>uttering<lb/>
                  to itself unheeded until the familiar voice of Friedrich Hee<del>e</del><del>r</del><unclear>r</unclear><unclear><del>r</del>e</unclear><lb/>
                  came through, reading one of his book reviews. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was consoling<lb/>
                  in a world where, suddenly, a signpost was missing. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>W<del>j</del>hat are<lb/>
                  you howling about, I asked myself, what gives you the right to<lb/>
                  mourn for Wystan? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Think of Chester. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was impossible not to<lb/>
                  think of Chester: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it was not so much a question how much he<lb/>
                  would grieve over the death of Wystan, as how he would survive<lb/>
                  at all. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Leaving the autobahn at St.Pölten I drove straight to<lb/>
                  Kirchstetten; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it seemed to be just possible that he might have<lb/>
                  arrived in the meantime. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But the green shutters were closed<lb/>
                  and there was no one about apart from the wall-eyed dog, an<lb/>
                  exceptionally hideous mongrel belonging to Frau Strobl, which<lb/>
                  barked in an irritating falsetto. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He barked from a position close<lb/>
                  beside me while I wrote a note and stuck it in the chink between<lb/>
                  the door´s shutters, and he was still barking as I shut the<lb/>
                  garden gate behind me.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The answer to my note was a telephone call from Frau Strobl:<lb/>
                  Herr Kallman said, would I come over to tea the next day?<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>That was the Sunday.

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The sittingroom seemed to be full of people. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del>-</del>Chester was<lb/>
                  sitting on the corner-seat facing the door, where Auden always<lb/>
                  used to sit, every <del>seat</del>chair appeared to be occupied and two young<lb/>
                  men were sitting <del>in the back</del> on the floor. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Chester hurried<lb/>
                  across the room, hugged me and said "The whole thing´s terrible,<lb/>
                  you have to help me."<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>I was introduced to the others. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Mrs. Thekla Clark and her<lb/>
                  daughter had come up from Florence as soon<del>a</del>as t<del>e</del>hey heard the<lb/>
                  news; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>there was Frau Maria Seitz, headmistress of the high school;<lb/>
                  <del>in Kirchstetten, the mayor Herr Enzinge</del>r Herr Enzinger the mayor<lb/>
                  of Kirchstetten, <del>a</del>the film scriptwriter Adolf Opel, and the young men.<lb/>
                  Clearly, the meeting to discuss the funeral arra<del>g</del>ngements was<lb/>
                  not proceeding smoothly. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The mayor looked annoyed, Frau Seitz<lb/>
                  looked worried and Mrs Clark bewildered. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There were, of course,<lb/>
                  language difficulties. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Mayor Enzinger spoke not a word of<lb/>
                  <del><unclear>G</unclear></del>English and the Clarks no German, while the headmistress had a<lb/>
                  certain command of English but did not feel up to acting as<lb/>
                  interpreter and adviser in one; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Chester´a German was perfect<del>k</del><unclear>l</unclear>y<lb/>
                  adequate.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>The root of the problem lay on a deeper level, where two<lb/>
                  separate cultures collided head on. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Chester was barely coherent,<lb/>
                  but he managed to explain his point of view. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He loathed, from<lb/>
                  the bottom of his hearteverything in the way of <hi rend="underline">pompes funèbres</hi>.<lb/>
                  He wanted to bury Aud<del>s</del><unclear>e</unclear>n, he said, quietly and privately and, if<lb/>
                  it could possibly be managed, on Tuesday. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He had already informed<lb/>
                  Wyst<del>s</del>an´s brother Dr. John Auden, Stephen Spender and <del>o</del>o<del>s</del>thers<lb/>
                  of the arran<del>t</del>gements and asked them to arrive, if not tomorrow,<lb/>
                  then on Tuesday morning at the latest. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>On the other hand the<lb/>
                  mayor of Kirchstetten, he went on, wanted to lay on a really big<lb/>
                  show with brass bands and all the rest of it, and what was more<lb/>
                  on the Saturday to give as many people as possible the chance to<lb/>
                  come. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The Ministry of Education and the provincial council of<lb/>
                  Lower Austria were to be represented, and as the last straw the<lb/>
                  hearse was to drive <del>i</del>up to the house. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He would not allow any of<lb/>
                  this, he said: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"I can´t bear it and I won´t have it."<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Mayor Enzinger drew a deep breath. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The first thing we ha<del>e</del>d<lb/>
                  to realise, he pointed out, was that the body had not yet been

                  released by the authorities. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In all cases where the cause of death<lb/>
                  is not wholly clear certain<unclear>k</unclear>formalities are obligatory, and even<lb/>
                  intervention at a high level would not work miracles. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Everything<lb/>
                  takes time. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And how could anyone expect it of him, the Bürgermeister<unclear>,</unclear><lb/>
                  that he should refrain from notifying the Ministry and the Cultural<lb/>
                  department of the Council of the <del>e</del>death of Professor _Auden? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It<lb/>
                  was as much as his job was worth. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Now Frau Seitz spoke. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The<lb/>
                  inhabitants of Kirchstetten, she believed, would hardly bury a dog<lb/>
                  in the manner proposed by Herr Kallman, let alone a great poet.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Chester Kallman´s position was entirely comprehensible - to<lb/>
                  some of us. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>To him, an <del>E</del>American of Jewish origin and a non-believer,<lb/>
                  the whole pomp and circumstance of a traditional Austrian funeral<lb/>
                  was abhorrent. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Where prominent personages are concerned, there<lb/>
                  would certainly be the local brass band, and where appropr<unclear>i</unclear>a<unclear>te</unclear> delegations representing<lb/>
                  the voluntary fire brigade, the federal railways, the veterans´<lb/>
                  association and others besides, and the gamekeepers would blow<lb/>
                  their horns and wish him good hunting in the Elysian fields.<lb/>
                  To Chester´s mind such folksy rituals were as foreign as the burial<lb/>
                  rites of the Incas. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He did not know that not very long ago in<lb/>
                  Lower Austria, Auden as a bachelor would have been accompanied in<lb/>
                  the funeral procession by a "bride" dressed in white. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He was<lb/>
                  unable to understand that his intentions were an intolerable affront<lb/>
                  to the population of Kirchstetten. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In his despair, it certainly<lb/>
                  never occurred to him that Auden himself would very likely have<lb/>
                  been entranced at the idea of a slap-up funeral with all the<lb/>
                  trimmings - one can almost hear his Olympian laughter - followed<lb/>
                  by a hearty meal at the inn where he had so often <del>ate</del>had his l<del>i</del>unch.<lb/>
                  As it turned out, Chester got no marks in local opinion for this<lb/>
                  finale either, as the meal consisted of <hi rend="underline">Leberkäs</hi> with vegetables:<lb/>
                  <unclear>T</unclear>his consisted of fried slices off a loaf of a flabby substance which is neither liver nor cheese related to the<lb/>
                  Frankfurter sausage. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It is a<lb/>
                  homely, juicy meal all too familiar to every Austrian; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>a<del>b</del>nd it is<lb/>
                  cheap.<del>n</del> There would be <del>mkuc</del> much talk of this also after all was ove<unclear>r</unclear><lb/>
                  For their part, the local people were forgetting that Chester was<lb/>
                  probably in financial straits - not that this would have been taken<lb/>
                  as an excuse.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>For a moment the discussion had come to a standstill.<lb/>

                  fetched more beer, Frau Strobl walked in and out and rolled a<lb/>
                  baleful eye on us as she spoke into Chester´s ear.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>The points at issue were not only When and How Much; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>there<lb/>
                  was also the matter of the church service and the prayers at the<lb/>
                  graveside. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Many people in Akustria had assumed Auden to be of the<lb/>
                  Roman Catholic faith; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>he had of course remained <hi rend="underline"><del>a</del></hi>:<del>s</del>member of the<lb/>
                  Anglican and Episcopalian churche<del><unclear>e</unclear></del>s. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The misunderstanding arose<lb/>
                  from his regular attendance at mass in the parish church and his<lb/>
                  friendly relationship with Father Lustkandl, the parish priest<lb/>
                  referred to in "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten". <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Auden asked<lb/>
                  Lustkandl´s sucessor for permission to be buried in the churchyard,<lb/>
                  and his wish was accede<del>o</del><unclear>d</unclear> to. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Evid<del>n</del>ently<unclear>,</unclear> <del>T</del>the next logical thing to do, then,<lb/>
                  was to approach the chaplain to the British Embassy in Vienna,´<lb/>
                  the Revd. Bruce Duncan, and ask him to officiate. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What form of<lb/>
                  service this should be - there could be no question of a funeral<lb/>
                  mass - left everyone present at a loss. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>We agreed at last that<lb/>
                  it ought to be some kind of ecumenical ceremony held jointly by<lb/>
                  the two clergymen, but that first of all, the plan must be put<lb/>
                  before <hi rend="underline">D</hi><del>D</del>r John Auden.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>At this juncture Chester Kallman withdrew his insistence on<lb/>
                  <del>an all too early funeral.</del> <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>the impossibly early date for the<lb/>
                  funeral. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The room had become much too warm, the oxygen was<lb/>
                  running out and Chester would not be able to stand much more<lb/>
                  pressure. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The most urgent <del>step</del> objective waslquite simply to<lb/>
                  free him from our burdensome presence. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Once everyone had agreed<lb/>
                  that Auden´s relations must be told immediately that the funeral<lb/>
                  <del>ah</del>had been postponed, the moment had come to dissolve the meeting.<lb/>
                  Mrs Clark undertook to telephone to London and Frau Strobl would<lb/>
                  drive her to the Post Office. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Chester asked me to talk everything<lb/>
                  over with Frau Seitz and Herr Enzinger and reach definite concl<del>i</del>u-<lb/>
                  sions. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>We all stood up, <hi rend="underline">C</hi>hester came across the room to me and<lb/>
                  spoke in an undertone. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He was completely exhausted, he said,<lb/>
                  he couldn´t stand much more. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"I´ll do anything you want, you<lb/>
                  must just try to hold the others in check." Finally he said<lb/>
                  "It´ll be all right, I´m crammed full of tranquillizers, all I<lb/>
                  need is a bit of a rest." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He embraced me warmly and left the room.

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>To British ears quite unremarkable, the ecumenic<del>la</del>al service<lb/>
                  was much ta<del>o</del>Iked about in A<del>ku</del>ustrian circles because nothing of the<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Reaching for my Authorised Version, for surely no one would<lb/>
                  have dared to use any other, on second thoughts I also took out the<lb/>
                  New Testament as translated into German by Martin Luther. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>After<lb/>
                  reading the English text through ve<del>d</del>ry slowly, and then a second<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>"It´s perfectly simple" said Auden. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"The initial impulse to<lb/>

                  <space quantity="6" unit="char"/>"Very neat" said Auden happily. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I like `evil chatter´<lb/>
