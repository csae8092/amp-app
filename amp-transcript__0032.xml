               <p>
                  Dear Stella,<lb/>
                  I just got back from a month in England to find your letter.  I was<lb/>
                  rather worried as to how you were, and am delighted to hear that<lb/>
                  you're on the ascent after a "decline."  I'm also abashed not to have<lb/>
                  been in touch with you before about the collapse of our four-memoir<lb/>
                  book, but the whole thing has been farcical and uncertain.  Here are<lb/>
                  the basics.  First, there should be no need to repay any of the<lb/>
                  advance (I haven't spoken with Random House about this, except with<lb/>
                  an ill-informed assitant, but there shouldn't be any problem), and<lb/>
                  second, I hope you haven't gone out of your way to work on the thing<lb/>
                  again.  The structure collapsed in two or three stages.  First Lincoln<lb/>
                  Kirstein read the forthcoming biography by Humphrey Carpenter (not bad,<lb/>
                  not spectacularly good), and decided he didn't know enough Auden to<lb/>
                  add new facts, that he wasn't really worthy to be a memoirist, etc.<lb/>
                  None of this has any truth, but Kirstein is not a person to argue with.<lb/>
                  He managed to persuade me, in September, that the book should at least<lb/>
                  be left to stew for a while.  Then Spender finally sent in a first<lb/>
                  draft of his piece, which, between us, was a disaster.  At this time<lb/>
                  Charles Monteith had a look at it, and agreed.  When I saw Charles<lb/>
                  in London a couple of weeks ago, we formally let the thing drop, and<lb/>
                  I think he already wrote you about it.<lb/>
                  I still think your piece is first-rate (the copyright is yours, by the<lb/>
                  way), and I hope you'll publish it, perhaps with a word or two of<lb/>
                  information from Christa Esders if that's possible.  (Did you learn<lb/>
                  anything from her??)  If you want me to try to place it in this country,<lb/>
                  I'll do my best with it.  Do let me know.  I feel very sorry that you<lb/>
                  went to all this trouble for--up to now--nothing, and for many reasons<lb/>
                  I should like to see the piece in print.<lb/>
                  No, I haven't got to Vienna for five years now, and couldn't afford<lb/>
                  a visit this year.  Next summer, if my job is sorted out, I would very<lb/>
                  much like to come over again.  This past summer I tried ringing you a<lb/>
                  few times at 4217175, but got no reply.  Is that your number?  Mine here<lb/>
                  is 212 222-0679 if there's ever a reason to need it.<lb/>
                  Please do forgive me for the muddle over the book.  And please do keep<lb/>
                  in touch.  Incidentally I finished that critical book--to be published<lb/>
                  in the spring--after doing nothing but work on it for a year.  My "summer"<lb/>
                  trip to England got postponed to November while I revised.<lb/>
                  Yours ever,<lb/>
                  Ed
